<p class='c006'>‘If we were to take away from the Museum Collection
[of Books] the King’s Library, and the collection which
George the Third gave before that, and then the
magnificent collection of Mr. Cracherode, as well as
those of Sir William Musgrave, Sir Joseph Banks, Sir
Richard Colt Hoare, and many others,—and also all the
books received under the Copyright Act,—if we were to
take away all the books so given, I am satisfied not one
half of the books [in 1836], nor one third of the <i>value</i> of
the Library, has been procured with money voted by the
Nation. The Nation has done almost nothing for the
Library....</p>

<p class='c007'>‘Considering the British Museum to be a National
Library for research, its utility increases in proportion
with the very rare and costly books, in preference to
modern books.... I think that scholars have a right
to look, for these expensive works, to the Government of
the Country....</p>

<p class='c007'>‘I want a poor student to have the same means of indulging
his learned curiosity,—of following his rational
pursuits,—of consulting the same authorities,—of fathoming
the most intricate inquiry,—as the richest man in the
kingdom, as far as books go. And I contend that Government
is bound to give him the most liberal and unlimited
assistance in this respect. I want the Library of the
British Museum to have books of both descriptions....</p>

<p class='c010'>The Reader has now seen that, within some twelve or
fifteen years, a Collection of Antiquities, comparatively small
and insignificant, was so enriched as to gain the aspect of a
National Museum of which all English-speaking men might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>be proud, and mere fragments of which enlightened Foreign
Sovereigns were under sore temptation to covet. He has
seen, also, that the praise of so striking a change was due,
in the main, to the public spirit and the liberal endeavours
of a small group of antiquarians and scholars. They were,
most of them, men of high birth, and of generous education.
They were, in fact, precisely such men as, in the
jargon of our present day, it is too much the mode to speak
of as the antitheses of ‘the People,’ although in earlier days
men of that strain were thought to be part of the very core
and kernel of a nation.</p>

<p class='c011'>But if it be undeniably true that the chief and primary
merit of so good a piece of public service was due to the
<span class='sc'>Hamiltons</span>, <span class='sc'>Towneleys</span>, <span class='sc'>Elgins</span>, and <span class='sc'>Knights</span> of the last
generation, it is also true that the Public, through their
representatives, did, at length, join fairly in the work by
bearing their part of the cost, though they could share
neither the enterprise, the self-denial, nor the wearing toils,
which the work had exacted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now that the story turns to another department of the
National Museum, we find that the same primary and salient
characteristic—private liberality of individuals, as distinguished
from public support by the Kingdom—still holds
good. But we have to wait a very long time indeed,
before we perceive public effort at length falling into rank
with private, in the shape of parliamentary grants for the
purchase of books, calculated even upon a rough approximation
towards equality.</p>

<p class='c011'>As <span class='sc'>Cotton</span>, <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, and Arthur <span class='sc'>Edwards</span>,
were the first founders of the Library, so <span class='sc'>Birch</span>, <span class='sc'>Musgrave</span>,
<span class='sc'>Tyrwhitt</span>, <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span>, <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, and <span class='sc'>Hoare</span>, were its
chief augmentors, until almost ninety years had elapsed
since the Act of Organization. Of the Collections of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>ten benefactors, eight came by absolute gift. For the other
two, much less than one half of their value was returned to
the representatives of the founders. And that, it has been
shown, was provided, not by a parliamentary grant, but out
of the profits of a lottery.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first important addition to the Library, subsequent
to those gifts which have been mentioned in a preceding
chapter as nearly contemporaneous with the creation of the
Museum, was made by the Will of Dr. Thomas <span class='sc'>Birch</span>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Bequest of Dr. Thomas Birch</span>, January, 1766.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
one
of the original Trustees. It comprised a valuable series of
manuscripts, rich in collections on the history, and especially
the biographical history, of the realm, and a considerable
number of printed books of a like character.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Birch</span> was born in 1705, and died on the ninth of
January, 1766. He was one of the many friends of Sir
Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>, in the later years of Sir Hans’ life. When
the Museum was in course of organization, <span class='sc'>Birch</span> acted
not only as a zealous Trustee, but he occasionally supplied
the place of Dr. <span class='sc'>Morton</span> as Secretary. His literary productions
have real and enduring value, though their value
would probably have been greater had their number been
less. His activity is sufficiently evidenced by the works
which he printed, but can only be measured when the
large manuscript collections which he bequeathed are taken
into the account. Very few scholars will now be inclined
to echo Horace <span class='sc'>Walpole’s</span> inquiry—made when he saw
the Catalogue of the Birch MSS.—‘Who cares for the correspondence
of Dr. <span class='sc'>Birch</span>?’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Bequest of David Garrick</span>, January, 1779.</div>

<p class='c011'>Soon after the receipt of the <span class='sc'>Birch</span> Collection, a choice
assemblage of English plays was bequeathed to the Museum
by David <span class='sc'>Garrick</span>. Its formation had been one of the
favourite relaxations of the great actor. And the study of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>the plays gathered by <span class='sc'>Garrick</span> had a large share in moulding
the tastes and the literary career of Charles <span class='sc'>Lamb</span>.
Thence he drew the materials of the volume of <cite>Specimens</cite>
which has made the rich stores of the early drama known to
thousands of readers who but for it, and for the Collection
which enabled him to compile it, could have formed no
fair or adequate idea of an important epoch in our
literature.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Benefactions of Sir W. Musgrave.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Sir William <span class='sc'>Musgrave</span> was another early Trustee whose
gifts to the Public illustrated the wisdom of <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> plan
for the government of his Museum and of its parliamentary
adoption. <span class='sc'>Musgrave</span> shared the predilection of Dr. <span class='sc'>Birch</span>
for the study of British biography and archæology, and he
had larger means for amassing its materials. He was
descended from a branch of the Musgraves of Edenhall, and
was the second son of Sir Richard <span class='sc'>Musgrave</span> of Hayton
Castle, to whom he eventually succeeded. He made large
and very curious manuscript collections for the history of
portrait-painting in England (now <cite>Additional MSS.</cite> 6391–6393),
and also on many points of the administrative and
political history of the country. He was a zealous Trustee
of the British Museum, and in his lifetime made several
additions to its stores. On his death, in 1799, all his manuscripts
were bequeathed to the Museum, together with a
Library of printed British Biography—more complete than
anything of its kind theretofore collected.</p>

<p class='c011'>This last-named Collection extended (if we include a
partial and previous gift made in 1790) to nearly two
thousand volumes, and it probably embraced much more
than twice that number of separate works. For it was
rich in those biographical ephemera which are so precious
to the historical inquirer, and often so difficult of obtainment,
when needed. Nearly at the same period (1786) a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>valuable Collection of classical authors, in about nine hundred
volumes, was bequeathed by another worthy Trustee,
Mr. Thomas <span class='sc'>Tyrwhitt</span>, distinguished both as a scholar and
as the Editor of <span class='sc'>Chaucer</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>But all the early gifts to the Museum, made after its
parliamentary organization, were eclipsed, at the close of
the century, by the bequest of the Cracherode Collections.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The
Bequest
of the
Cracherode
Collection.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
That bequest comprised a very choice library of printed
books; a cabinet of coins, medals, and gems; and a series
of original drawings by the great masters, chosen, like the
books and the coins, with exquisite taste, and, as the
auctioneers say, quite regardless of expense.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1799.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It also
included a small but precious cabinet of minerals.</p>

<p class='c011'>The collector of these rarities was wont to speak of
them with great modesty. They are, he would say, mere
‘specimen collections.’ But to amass them had been the
chief pursuit of a quiet and blameless life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Life and Character of Mr. Mordaunt Cracherode.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Clayton Mordaunt <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span> was born in London
about the year 1730. And he was ‘a Londoner’ in a sense
and degree to which, in this railway generation, it would
be hard to find a parallel. Among the rich possessions
which he inherited from Colonel <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span>, his father—whose
fortune had been gathered, or increased, during an
active career in remote parts of the world—was an estate
in Hertfordshire, on which there grew a certain famous
chestnut-tree, the cynosure of all the country-side for its
size and antiquity. This tree was never seen by its new
owner, save as he saw the poplars of Lombardy, or the
cedars of Lebanon—in an etching. In the course of a long
life he never reached a greater distance from the metropolis
than Oxford. He never mounted a horse. The ordinary
extent of his travels, during the prime years of a long life,
was from Queen Square, in Westminster, to Clapham. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>almost forty years it was his daily practice to walk from his
house to the shop of <span class='sc'>Elmsly</span>, a bookseller in the Strand,
and thence to the still more noted shop of Tom <span class='sc'>Payne</span>, by
‘the Mews-Gate.’ Once a week, he varied the daily walk
by calling on <span class='sc'>Mudge</span>, a chronometer-maker, to get his
watch regulated. His excursions had, indeed, one other
and not infrequent variety—dictated by the calls of
Christian benevolence—but of these he took care to have no
note taken.</p>

<p class='c011'>Early in life, and probably to meet his father’s wish, he
received holy orders, but he never accepted any preferment
in the Church. He took the restraints of the clerical profession,
without any of its emoluments. His classical
attainments were considerable, but the sole publication of a
long life of leisure was a university prize poem, printed in
the <cite>Carmina Quadragesimalia</cite> of 1748. The only early
tribulation of a life of idyllic peacefulness was a dread that
he might possibly be called upon, at a coronation, to appear
in public as the King’s cupbearer—his manor of Great
Wymondley being held by a tenure of grand-serjeantry in
that onerous employment. Its one later tinge of bitterness
lay in the dread of a French invasion. These may seem
small sorrows, to men who have had a full share in the
stress and anguish of the battle of life. But the weight of
a burden is no measure of the pain it may inflict. Mr.
<span class='sc'>Cracherode</span> looked to his possible cupbearership, with
apprehension just as acute as that with which <span class='sc'>Cowper</span>
contemplated the awful task of reading in public the
Journals of the House of Lords. And the sleepless nights
which long afterwards were brought to <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span>
by the horrors of the French revolutionary war were
caused less by personal fears than by the dread of
public calamities, more terrible than death. During one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>year of the devastations on the other side of the Channel,
chronicled by our daily papers, Mr. <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span> was
thought by his friends to have ‘aged’ full ten years in his
aspect.</p>

<p class='c011'>The one active and incessant pursuit of this noiseless
career was the gathering together of the most choice books,
the finest coins and gems, the most exquisite drawings and
prints, which money could buy, without the toils of travel.
Our Collector’s liberality of purse enabled him to profit, at his
ease, by the truth expressed in one of the wise maxims of
John <span class='sc'>Selden</span>:—‘The giving a dealer his price hath this
advantage;—he that will do so shall have the refusal of
whatsoever comes to the dealer’s hand, and so by that
means get many things which otherwise he never should
have seen.’ The enjoyment—almost a century ago—of six
hundred pounds a year in land, and of nearly one hundred
thousand pounds invested in the ‘sweet simplicity’ of the
three per cents., enabled Mr. <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span> to outbid a
good many competitors. His natural wish that what he
had so eagerly gathered should not be scattered to the four
winds on the instant he was carried to his grave, and also
the public spirit which dictated the choice of a national
repository as the permanent abode of his Collections, has
already made that long course of daily visits to the London
dealers in books, coins, and drawings, fruitful of good to
hundreds of poorer students and toilers, during more than two
generations. From stores such as Mr. <span class='sc'>Cracherode’s</span>—when
so preserved—many a useful labourer gets part of his
best equipment for the tasks of his life. He, too, would
enjoy a visit to the ‘<span class='sc'>Paynes</span>’ and the ‘<span class='sc'>Elmslys</span>’ of the
day as keenly as any book-lover that ever lived, but is too
often, perhaps, obliged to content himself with an outside
glance at the windows. Public libraries put him practically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>on a level with the wealthiest connoisseur. When, as
in this case—and in a hundred more—such libraries derive
much of their best possessions from private liberality, a life
like Mordaunt <span class='sc'>Cracherode’s</span> has its ample vindication,
and the sting is taken out of all such sarcasms
as that which was levelled—in the shape of the
query, ‘In all that big library is there a single book
written by the Collector himself?’—by some snarling
epistolary critic, when commenting on a notice that appeared
in <cite>The Times</cite> on the occasion of Mr. <span class='sc'>Cracherode’s</span>
death.</p>

<p class='c011'>On another point our Collector was exposed to the
shafts of sarcastic comment. He loved a good book to be
printed on the very choicest material, and clothed in the
richest fashion. The treasure within would not incline him
to tolerate blemishes without.—</p>

<p class='c011'>In <span class='sc'>Cracherode’s</span> eyes, external charms such as these
were scarcely less essential than the intrinsic worth of
the author. ‘Large paper’ and broad pure margins are
fancies which it needs not much culture or much wit to
banter. But now and then, they are ridiculed by those
who have just as little capacity to judge the pith and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>substance of books, as of taste to appreciate beauty in
their outward form.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>The solidity of those three per cents., and the plodding
perseverance of their owner, were in time rewarded by the
collection (1) of a library containing only four thousand
five hundred volumes, but of which probably every volume—on
an average of the whole—was worth, in mercantile
eyes, some three pounds; (2) of seven portfolios of drawings,
still more choice; (3) of a hundred portfolios of prints,
many of which were almost priceless; and (4) of coins and
gems—such as the cameo of a lion on sardonyx, and the
intaglio of the <em>Discobolos</em>—worthy of an imperial cabinet.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ruling passion kept its strength to the last. An
agent was buying prints, for addition to the store, when the
Collector was dying. About four days before his death,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span> mustered strength to pay a farewell visit
to the old shop at the Mews-Gate. He put a finely printed
<cite>Terence</cite> (from the press of <span class='sc'>Foulis</span>) into one pocket, and a
large paper <cite>Cebes</cite> into another; and then,—with a longing
look at a certain choice <cite>Homer</cite>, in the course of which he
mentally, and somewhat doubtingly, balanced its charms with
those of its twin brother in Queen Square,—parted finally
from the daily haunt of forty peripatetic and studious years.</p>

<p class='c011'>Clayton Mordaunt <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span> died towards the close
of 1799. He bequeathed the whole of his collections to the
Nation, with the exception of two volumes of books. A
polyglot <cite>Bible</cite> was given to Shute <span class='sc'>Barrington</span>, Bishop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>of Durham; a princeps <cite>Homer</cite> to Cyril <span class='sc'>Jackson</span>, Dean of
Christ Church. Those justly venerated men were his two
dearest friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>The next conspicuous donor to the Library of the British
Museum was a contemporary of the learned recluse of
Queen Square, but one whose life was passed in the thick
of that worldly turmoil and conflict of which Mr. <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span>
had so mortal a dread.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The
Collector
of the
Lansdowne
Manuscripts.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To the Collector of the
‘Lansdowne Manuscripts,’ political excitement was the
congenial air in which it was indeed life to live. But he,
also, was a man beloved by all who had the privilege of his
intimate friendship.</p>

<p class='c011'>William <span class='sc'>Petty-Fitzmaurice</span>, third Earl of Shelburne,
and first Marquess of Lansdowne, was born in Dublin, in
May, 1737. He was the son of John, Earl of Shelburne in
the peerage of Ireland, and afterwards Baron Wycombe in
the peerage of Great Britain. The Marquess’s father united
the possessions of the family founded by Sir William <span class='sc'>Petty</span>
with those which the Irish wars had left to the ancient line
of Fitzmaurice.</p>

<p class='c011'>William, Earl of <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span>, was educated by private
tutors, and then sent to Christ Church, Oxford. He left
the University early, to take (in or about the year 1756) a
commission in the Guards. He was present in the battles
of Campen and of Minden. At Minden, in particular, he
evinced distinguished bravery. In May, 1760, and again
in April, 1761, he was elected by the burgesses of High
Wycombe to represent them in the House of Commons.
But the death of Earl John, in the middle of 1761, called
his son to take his seat in the House of Lords. He soon
evinced the possession of powers eminently fitted to shine
in Parliament. The impetuosity he had shown on the field
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>of Minden did not desert him in the strife of politics.
Those who had listened to the early speeches of <span class='sc'>Pitt</span> might
well think that the army had again sent them a ‘terrible
cornet of horse.’ So good a judge of political oratory as
was Lord <span class='sc'>Camden</span> thought <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> to be second only
to <span class='sc'>Chatham</span> himself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Beginning of Lord Shelburne’s Career in Parliament.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span> first speech in Parliament—the first,
at least, that attracted general notice—was made in support
of the Court and the Ministry (November 3, 1762). Within
less than six months after its delivery he was called to the
Privy Council, and placed at the head of the Board of Trade
and Plantations. This appointment was made on the
23rd of April, 1763. Just before it he had taken part in
that delicate negotiation between Lord <span class='sc'>Bute</span> and Henry <span class='sc'>Fox</span>
(afterwards Lord <span class='sc'>Holland</span>) which has been kept well in
memory by a jest of the man who thought himself the loser
in it. This early incident is in some sort a key to many
later incidents in Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span> life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Shelburne and Henry Fox.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>For, in all the acts and offices of a political career, save
only one, Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> was characteristically a lover of
soft words. In debate, he could speak scathingly. In
conversation, he was always under temptation to flatter his
interlocutor. In this conversation of 1763 with <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span>
innate love of smoothing asperities co-operated with
his belief that it was really for the common interest that
<span class='sc'>Bute</span> and <span class='sc'>Fox</span> should come to an agreement, to make him
put the premier’s offer into the most pleasing light. When
<span class='sc'>Fox</span> found he was to get less than he thought to have, he
fiercely assailed the negotiator. Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span> friends
dwelt on his love of peace and good fellowship. At worst,
said they, it was but a ‘pious fraud.’ ‘I can see the
fraud plainly enough,’ rejoined <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, ‘but where is the
piety?’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>The office accepted in April was resigned in September,
when the coalition with ‘the <span class='sc'>Bedford</span> party’ was made.
Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span> loss was felt in the House of Lords.
But it was in the Commons that the Ministry were now
feeblest. ‘I don’t see how they can meet Parliament,’
said <span class='sc'>Chesterfield</span>. ‘In the Commons they have not a man
with ability and words enough to call a coach.’</p>

<p class='c011'>In February, 1765, <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> married Lady Sophia
<span class='sc'>Carteret</span>, one of the daughters of the Earl of <span class='sc'>Granville</span>.
The marriage was a very happy one. Not long after it, he
began to form his library.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Formation
of Lord
Shelburne’s
Library.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Political manuscripts, state
papers of every kind, and all such documents as tend to
throw light on the arcana of history, were, more especially,
the objects which he sought. And the quest, as will be seen
presently, was very successful. For during his early researches
he had but few competitors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Secretaryship of State.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>On the organization of the Duke of <span class='sc'>Grafton’s</span> Ministry
in 1766 (July 30) Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> was made Secretary of
State for the Southern Department, to which at that time
the Colonial business was attached.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1766–1768.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His colleague, in the
Northern, was <span class='sc'>Conway</span>, who now led the House of Commons.
As Secretary, Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span> most conspicuous
and influential act was his approval of that rejection of
certain members of the Council of Massachusetts by
Governor <span class='sc'>Bernard</span>, which had so important a bearing on
colonial events to come.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Shelburne</span>, however, was one of a class of statesmen of
whom, very happily, this country has had many. He was
able to render more efficient service in opposition than in
office. Of the Board of Trade he had had the headship but
a few months. As Secretary of State, under the <span class='sc'>Grafton</span>
Administration, he served little more than two years. His
opponents were wont to call him an ‘impracticable’ man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>But if he shared some of <span class='sc'>Chatham’s</span> weaknesses, he also
shared much of his greatness. And on the capital question
of the American dispute, they were at one. They both
thought that the Colonies had been atrociously misgoverned.
They were willing to make large concessions to regain the
loyalty of the Colonists. They were utterly averse to admit
of a severance.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Lord Shelburne in Opposition.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Under circumstances familiar to all readers, and by the
personal urgency of the King, Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> was dismissed
from his first Secretaryship in October, 1768. His
dismissal led to <span class='sc'>Chatham’s</span> resignation. <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> became
a prominent and powerful leader of the Opposition, an
object of special dislike to a large force of political adversaries,
and of warm attachment to a small number of political
friends. His personal friends were, at all times, many.</p>

<p class='c011'>The nickname under which his opponents were wont to
satirize him has been kept in memory by one of the many
infelicities of speech which did such cruel injustice to the
fine parts and the generous heart of <span class='sc'>Goldsmith</span>. The story
has been many times told, but will bear to be told once again.
The author of the <cite>Vicar of Wakefield</cite> was an occasional supporter
of the Opposition in the newspapers. One day, in
the autumn of 1773, he wrote an article in praise of Lord
<span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span> ardent friend in the City, the Lord Mayor
<span class='sc'>Townshend</span>. Sitting, in company with Topham <span class='sc'>Beauclerc</span>,
at Drury Lane Theatre, just after the appearance of
the article, <span class='sc'>Goldsmith</span> found himself close beside Lord
<span class='sc'>Shelburne</span>. His companion told the statesman that his
City friend’s eulogy came from <span class='sc'>Goldsmith’s</span> pen.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1773.
November.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘I
hope,’ said his Lordship—addressing the poet—‘you put
nothing in it about Malagrida?’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Hardy,
<cite>Life of Lord
Charlemont</cite>,
vol. i, p. 177.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘Do you know,’ rejoined
poor <span class='sc'>Goldsmith</span>, ‘I could never conceive the reason why
they call you “Malagrida,”—<em>for</em> Malagrida was a very good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>sort of man.’ This small misplacement of an emphasis was
of course quoted in the clubs against the unlucky speaker.
‘Ah!’ said Horace <span class='sc'>Walpole</span>, with his wonted charity,
‘that’s a picture of the man’s whole life.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Growth of Lord Shelburne’s Library.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span> library profited by his long releasement
from the cares of office. He bestowed much of his
leisure upon its enrichment, and especially upon the acquisition
of manuscript political literature. In 1770, he was
fortunate enough to obtain a considerable portion of the
large and curious Collection of State Papers which Sir Julius
<span class='sc'>Cæsar</span> had begun to amass almost two centuries before.
Two years later, he acquired no inconsiderable portion of
that far more important series which had been gathered by
<span class='sc'>Burghley</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Cæsar Papers.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Whilst Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> was serving with the army in
Germany, the ‘Cæsar Papers’ had been dispersed by
auction. There were then—1757—a hundred and eighty-seven
of them. About sixty volumes were purchased by
Philip Cartaret <span class='sc'>Webb</span>, a lawyer and juridical writer, as
well as antiquary, of some distinction. On Mr. <span class='sc'>Webb’s</span>
death, in 1770, these were purchased by <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> from
his executors. On examining his acquisition, the new
possessor found that about twenty volumes related to
various matters of British history and antiquities; thirty-one
volumes to the business of the British Admiralty and
its Courts; ten volumes to that of the Treasury, Star
Chamber, and other public departments; two volumes contained
treaties; and one volume, papers on the affairs of
Ireland.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Cecil or Burghley Papers.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The ‘Burghley papers,’ acquired in 1772, had passed
from Sir Michael <span class='sc'>Hickes</span>, one of that statesman’s secretaries,
to a descendant, Sir William <span class='sc'>Hickes</span>, by whom
they were sold to <span class='sc'>Chiswell</span>, a bookseller, and by him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span><span class='sc'>Strype</span>, the historian. These (as has been mentioned
in a former chapter) were looked upon with somewhat
covetous eyes by Humphrey <span class='sc'>Wanley</span>, who hoped to have
seen them become part of the treasures of the Harleian
Library. On <span class='sc'>Strype’s</span> death they passed into the hands
of James <span class='sc'>West</span>, and from his executors into the Library
at Shelburne House. They comprised a hundred and
twenty-one volumes of the collections and correspondence
of Lord <span class='sc'>Burghley</span>, together with his private note-book
and journal.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another valuable acquisition, made after Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span>
retirement in 1768 from political office, consisted
of the vast historical Collections of Bishop White <span class='sc'>Kennett</span>,
extending to a hundred and seven volumes, of which a
large proportion are in the Bishop’s own untiring hand.
Twenty-two of these volumes contain important materials
for English Church History. Eleven volumes contain
biographical collections, ranging between the years 1500
and 1717. All that have been enumerated are now national
property.</p>

<p class='c011'>Other choice manuscript collections were added from
time to time. Among them may be cited the papers of
Sir Paul <span class='sc'>Rycaut</span>—which include information both on
Irish and on Continental affairs towards the close of the
seventeenth century; the correspondence of Dr. John
<span class='sc'>Pell</span>, and that of the Jacobite Earl of <span class='sc'>Melfort</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>These varied accessions—with many others of minor
importance—raised the Shelburne Library into the first
rank among private repositories of historical lore. To
amass and to study them was to prove to its owner the
solace of deep personal affliction, as well as the relief of
public toils. At the close of 1770, he lost a beloved wife,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>after a union of less than six years. He remained a
widower until 1779.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another source of solace was found in labours that have
an inexhaustible charm, for those who are so happy as to
have means as well as taste for them.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Lord Shelburne
as a
Landscape
Gardener.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span>
lived much at Loakes—now called Wycombe Abbey—a
delightful seat, just above the little town of High Wycombe.
Its striking framework of beech-woods, its fine plane-trees
and ash-trees, and its broad piece of water, make up
a lovely picture, much of the attraction of which is due to
the skill and judgment with which its then owner elicited
and heightened the natural beauties of the place.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> But
those of Bowood exceeded them in Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span>
eyes. There, too, he did very much to enhance what
nature had already done, and he had the able assistance
of Mr. <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> of Pains-Hill. In consequence of their
joint labours, almost every species of oak may be seen at
Bowood, with great variety of exotic trees of all sorts.
Both wood and water combine to make, from some points
of view, a resemblance between Wycombe and Bowood.
And both differ from many much bepraised country seats
in the wise preference of natural beauty—selected and
heightened—to artificial beauty. Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> himself
was wont to say: ‘Mere workmanship should never be
introduced where the beauty and variety of the scenery
are, in themselves, sufficient to excite admiration.’</p>

<p class='c011'>But, in their true place, few men better loved the productions
of artistic genius. He collected pictures and
sculpture, as well as trees and books. He was the first of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>his name who made Lansdowne House in London, as well
as Loakes and Bowood in the country, centres of the best
society in the intellectual as well as in the fashionable
world.</p>

<p class='c011'>Years passed on. The course of public events—and
especially the death of Lord <span class='sc'>Chatham</span> and the issues of
the American war—together with many conspicuous proofs
of his powers in debate, tended more and more to bring
Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> to the front. Between him and Lord
<span class='sc'>Rockingham</span>, as far as regards real personal ability—whether
parliamentary or administrative—there could, in
truth, be little ground for comparison. But in party connection
and following, the claims of the inferior man were
incontestible. Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span>, towards the close of
1779, signified his readiness to waive his pretensions to
take the lead—in the event of the overthrow of the existing
Government—and his willingness to serve under
Lord <span class='sc'>Rockingham</span>; so little truth was there in the assertion,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>H. Walpole
to Mann;
1780.
March 21.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
made by Horace <span class='sc'>Walpole</span> to his correspondent at
Florence, that <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> ‘will stick at nothing to gratify
his ambition.’</p>

<p class='c011'>But that very charge is, in fact, a tribute. <span class='sc'>Walpole’s</span>
indignation had been excited just at that moment by the
zealous assistance which <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> had given, in the
House of Lords, to the efforts of <span class='sc'>Burke</span> in the lower
House in favour of economical reforms. He had brought
forward a motion on that subject on the same night on
which <span class='sc'>Burke</span> had given notice for the introduction of
his famous Bill (December, 1779). He continued his
efforts, and presently had to encounter a more active and
pertinacious opponent of retrenchment than Horace <span class='sc'>Walpole</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the course of a vigorous speech on reform in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>administration of the army, Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> had censured
a transaction in which Mr. <span class='sc'>Fullerton</span>, a Member
of the House of Commons, was intimately concerned.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Lord Shelburne’s
Duel with
Fullerton.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Fullerton</span> made a violent attack, in his place in the
House, upon his censor. But his speech was so disorderly
that he was forced to break off. In his anger he sent
Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> a minute, not only of what he had
actually spoken, but of what he had intended to say, in
addition, had the rules of Parliament permitted. And he
had the effrontery to wind up his obliging communication
with these words:—‘You correspond, as I have heard
abroad, with the enemies of your country.’ His letter
was presented to Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> by a messenger.</p>

<p class='c011'>The receiver, when he had read it, said to the bearer:
‘The best answer I can give Mr. <span class='sc'>Fullerton</span> is to desire
him to meet me in Hyde Park, at five, to-morrow morning.’
They fought, and <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> was wounded. On being
asked how he felt himself, he looked at the wound, and
said: ‘I do not think that Lady <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> will be the
worse for this.’ But it was severe enough to interrupt,
for a while, his political labours.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>His Secretaryship in the Rockingham Administration.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>On the formation in March, 1782, of the Rockingham
Administration, he accepted the Secretaryship of State, and
took with him four of his adherents into the Cabinet. But
the most curious feature in the transaction was that Lord
<span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> carried on, personally, all the intercourse in the
royal closet that necessarily preceded the formation of the
Ministry, although he was not to be its head. <span class='sc'>George
the Third</span> would not admit Lord <span class='sc'>Rockingham</span> to an
audience until his Cabinet was completely formed. The
man whose exclusion from the Grafton Ministry the King
had so warmly urged a few years before, was now not less
warmly urged by him to throw over his party, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>head a cabinet of his own. He resisted all blandishment,
and virtually told the King that the triumph of the Opposition
must be its triumph as an unbroken whole; though
he doubtless felt, within himself, that the cohesion was of
singularly frail tenacity.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the 24th of March, <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> had the satisfaction
of conveying to Lord <span class='sc'>Rockingham</span> the royal concession of
his constitutional demands—obtained after a wearisome
negotiation, and only by the piling up of argument on
argument in successive conversations at the ‘Queen’s
House,’ lasting sometimes for three mortal hours.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Death of
Lord Rockingham</span>,
1782, 1 July.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Three
months afterwards, the new Premier was dead. And with
him departed the cohesion of the Whigs.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Formation of Lord Shelburne’s Ministry.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>As Secretary of State, Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span> chief task
had been the control of that double and most unwelcome
negotiation which was carried on at Paris with France and
with America.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> For it had fallen to the lot of the utterer
of the ‘sunset-speech,’<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a>—‘if we let America go, the sun of
Great Britain is set’—to arrange the terms of American
pacification. And the obstructions in that path which
were created at home were even more serious stumbling-blocks
than were the difficulties abroad. The cardinal
points of Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span> policy, at this time, were to
retain, by hook or crook, some amount or other of hold
upon America, and at the worst to keep the Court of
France from enjoying the prestige, or setting up the pretence,
of having dictated the terms of peace.</p>

<p class='c011'>That the split in the Whig party was really and altogether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>inevitable, now that <span class='sc'>Rockingham’s</span> death had placed
<span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> above reasonable competition for the premiership,
was made known to him when at Court, in the most
abrupt manner. On the 7th of July (six days after the
death of the Marquess), Fox took him by the sleeve, with
the blunt question: ‘Are you to be First Lord of the
Treasury?’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Walpole to
Mann (from
an eye witness),
1782,
July 7.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> said ‘Yes,’ the instant
rejoinder was, ‘Then, my Lord, I shall resign.’ Fox had
brought the seals in his pocket, and proceeded immediately
to return them to the King.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his first speech as Premier, Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> spoke
thus:—‘It has been said that I have changed my opinion
about the independence of America.... My opinion is still
the same. When that independence shall have been established,
the sun of England may be said to have set. I
have used every effort, public and private—in England, and
out of it—to avert so dreadful a disaster....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Parliamentary
Debates</cite>,
vol. xxiii,
col. 194.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But though
this country should have received a fatal blow, there is still
a duty incumbent upon its Ministers to use their most
vigorous exertions to prevent the Court of France from
being in a situation to dictate the terms of Peace. The sun
of England may have set. But we will improve the twilight.
We will prepare for the rising of that sun again.
And I hope England may yet see many, many happy
days.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The best achievements of the brief government of Lord
<span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> were (first) the resolute defence, in its diplomacy
at Paris and Versailles, of our territories in Canada, and
(secondly) its consistent assertion of the principle that
underlay a sentence contained in a former speech of the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Merits of
the Shelburne
Ministry.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Premier—a sentence which, at one time, was much upon
men’s lips:—‘I will never consent,’ he had said, ‘that the
King of England shall be a King of the Mahrattas.’ The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>merits, I venture to think, of that short Ministry, have had
scant acknowledgment in our current histories. And the
reason is, perhaps, not far to seek.</p>

<p class='c011'>The popular history of <span class='sc'>George the Third’s</span> reign has
been, in a large degree, imbued with Whiggism. The historians
most in vogue have had a sort of small apostolical
succession amongst themselves, which has had the result of
giving a strong party tinge to those versions of the course of
political events in that reign which have most readily
gained the public ear. When the full story shall come to
be told, in a later day and from a higher stand-point, Lord
<span class='sc'>Shelburne</span>, not improbably, will be one among several
statesmen whose reputation with posterity (in common—in
some measure—with that of their royal master himself, it
may even be) will be found to have been elevated, rather than
lowered, by the process.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><cite>Debates</cite>, vol. xix, col. 850.</div>

<p class='c011'>But, be that as it may, party intrigue, rather than ministerial
incapacity, had to do, confessedly, with the rapid
overthrow of the Government of July, 1782.</p>

<p class='c011'>Personally, Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> was in a position which, in
several points of view, bears a resemblance to that in which
another able statesman, who had to fight against a powerful
coterie, was to find himself forty years later. But in
<span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span> case, the struggle of the politician did not, as
in <span class='sc'>Canning’s</span>, break down the bodily vigour of the man.
Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> had twenty-two years of retirement yet
before him, when he resigned the premiership in 1783. And
they were years of much happiness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The closing Years of Lord Lansdowne’s Life.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Part of that happiness was the result of the domestic
union just adverted to. Another part of it accrued from
the rich Library which the research and attention of many
years had gradually built up, and from the increased leisure
that had now been secured, both for study and for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>enjoyment of the choice society which gathered habitually
at Lansdowne House and at Bowood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne’s</span> retirement had been followed, in
1784, by his creation as Earl Wycombe and Marquess of
Lansdowne. In the following year, he sold the Wycombe
mansion and its charming park to Lord <span class='sc'>Carrington</span>.
Thenceforward, Bowood had the benefit, exclusively, of his
taste and skill in landscape-gardening. Unfortunately, his
next successor, far from continuing his father’s work, did
much to injure and spoil it. But the third Marquess, in
whom so many of his father’s best qualities were combined
with some that were especially his own, made ample
amends.</p>

<p class='c011'>The exciting debates which grew out of the French Revolution
and the ensuing events on the Continent, called
Lord <span class='sc'>Lansdowne</span>, now and then, into the old arena. But
the domestic employments which have been mentioned,
together with that which was entailed by a large and varied
correspondence, both at home and abroad, were the things
which chiefly filled up his later years. The Marquess died
in London on the seventh of May, 1805. He was but
sixty-eight years of age, yet he was then the oldest general
officer on the army list, having been gazetted as a major-general
just forty years before.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Purchase of the Lansdowne Manuscripts.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In order to acquire for the nation that precious portion
of Lord <span class='sc'>Lansdowne’s</span> Library which was in manuscript, the
national purse-strings were now, for the first time, opened
on behalf of the literary stores of the British Museum.
Fifty-three years had passed since its complete foundation
as a national institution, and exactly twice that number of
years since the first public establishment of the Cottonian
Library, yet no grant had been hitherto made by Parliament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>for the improvement of the national collections of
books.</p>

<p class='c011'>Four thousand nine hundred and twenty-five pounds was
the sum given to Lord <span class='sc'>Lansdowne’s</span> executors for his
manuscripts. Besides the successive accumulations of
State Papers heretofore mentioned, the <span class='sc'>Lansdowne</span> Collection
included other historical documents, extending in
date from the reign of <span class='sc'>Henry the Sixth</span> to that of
<span class='sc'>George the Third</span>; the varied Collections of William
<em>Petyt</em> on parliamentary and juridical lore; those of <span class='sc'>Warburton</span>
on the topography and family history of Yorkshire,
and of <span class='sc'>Holles</span>, containing matter of a like character for
the local concerns of the county of Lincoln; the Heraldic
and Genealogical Collections of <span class='sc'>Segar</span>, <span class='sc'>Saint George</span>,
<span class='sc'>Dugdale</span>, and <span class='sc'>Le Neve</span>; and a most curious series of
early treatises upon music, which had been collected by
John <span class='sc'>Wylde</span>, who was for many years precentor of
Waltham Abbey, in the time of the second of the Tudor
monarchs.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Acquisition of the Hargrave and Burney Libraries.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The Lansdowne Collection did not contain very much
of a classical character. Its strength, it has been seen
already, lay in the sections of Modern History and Politics.
The next important addition to the Library of the Museum—that
of the manuscripts and printed books of Francis
<span class='sc'>Hargrave</span>—was likewise chiefly composed of political
and juridical literature. But the third parliamentary
acquisition brought to the Museum a store of classical
wealth, both in manuscripts and in printed books. <span class='sc'>Hargrave’s</span>
Legal Library was bought in 1813. Charles <span class='sc'>Burney’s</span>
Classical Library was bought in 1818. In the biographical
point of view neither of these men ran a career
which offers much of narrative interest. The one career
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>was that of a busy lawyer; the other, that of a laborious
scholar. But to <span class='sc'>Burney’s</span> life a few sentences may be
briefly and fitly given.</p>

<p class='c011'>The second Charles <span class='sc'>Burney</span> was a younger son of the
well-known historian of Music, who for more than fifty
years was a prominent figure in the literary circles—and
especially in the Johnsonian circle—of London; and in
whose well-filled life a very moderate share of literary
ability was made to go a long way, and to elicit a very
resonant echo. That ‘clever dog <span class='sc'>Burney</span>,’ as he was
wont to be called by the autocrat of the dinner-table, had
the good fortune to be the father of several children even
more clever than himself. Their reputation enhanced his
own.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Life and Literary Works of Dr. Chas. Burney.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Charles <span class='sc'>Burney</span>, junior, was born at Lynn, in Norfolk,
on the 10th of December, 1757. He was educated at the
Charter House in London, at Caius College, Cambridge,
and at King’s College, Aberdeen. At Aberdeen, <span class='sc'>Burney</span>
formed a friendship with Dr. <span class='sc'>Dunbar</span>, a Scottish professor
of some distinction, and an incident which grew, in after-years,
out of that connection, determined the scene and
character of the principal employments of <span class='sc'>Burney’s</span> life.
He devoted himself to scholastic labours, in both senses
of the term; their union proved mutually advantageous,
and as tuition gave leisure for literary labour, so the successful
issues of that labour spread far and wide his fame
as a schoolmaster. He was one of the not very large
group of men who in that employment have won wealth
as well as honour. It was finely said, many years ago—in
one of the State Papers written by <span class='sc'>Guizot</span>, when he
was Minister of Public Instruction in France—‘the good
schoolmaster must work for man, and be content to await
his reward from God.’ In <span class='sc'>Burney’s</span> case, the combined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>assiduity of an energetic man at the author’s writing-table,
at the master’s desk, and also (it must in truthful
candour be added) at his flogging block,<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c013'><sup>[5]</sup></a> brought him a
large fortune as well as a wide-spread reputation. This
fortune enabled him to collect what, for a schoolmaster, I
imagine to have been a Classical Library hardly ever rivalled
in beauty and value. It was the gathering of
a deeply read critic, as well as of an open-handed purchaser.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bias of Dr. <span class='sc'>Burney’s</span> learning and tastes in literature
led him to a preference of the Greek classics far
above the Latin. Naturally, his Library bore this character
in counterpart. He aimed at collecting Greek authors—and
especially the dramatists—in such a way that the
collocation of his copies gave a sort of chronological view
of the literary history of the books and of their successive
recensions.</p>

<p class='c011'>For the tragedians, more particularly, his researches
were brilliantly successful. Of <cite>Æschylus</cite> he had amassed
forty-seven editions; of <cite>Sophocles</cite>, one hundred and two;
of <cite>Euripides</cite>, one hundred and sixty-six.</p>

<p class='c011'>His first publication was a sharp criticism (in the <cite>Monthly
Review</cite>) on Mr. (afterwards Bishop) <span class='sc'>Huntingford’s</span> Collection
of Greek poems entitled <cite>Monostrophica</cite>. This was
followed, in 1789, by the issue of an Appendix to <span class='sc'>Scapula’s</span>
Lexicon; and in 1807 by a collection of the correspondence
of <span class='sc'>Bentley</span> and other scholars. Two years
later, he gave to students of Greek his <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tentamen de Metris
ab Æschylo in choricis cantibus adhibitis</span></cite>, and to the youthful
theologians his meritorious abridgment of Bishop <span class='sc'>Pearson’s</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span><cite>Exposition of the Creed</cite>. In 1812, he published the Lexicon
of <span class='sc'>Philemon</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The only Church preferments enjoyed by Dr. <span class='sc'>Burney</span>
were the rectory of St. Paul, Deptford, near London,
and that of Cliffe, also in Kent. His only theological publication—other
than the abridgment of <span class='sc'>Pearson</span>—was a
sermon which he had preached in St. Paul’s Cathedral in
1812. Late in life he was made a Prebendary of
Lincoln.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like his father, and others of his family, Charles
<span class='sc'>Burney</span> was a very sociable man. He lived much with
<span class='sc'>Parr</span> and with <span class='sc'>Porson</span>, and, like those eminent scholars, he
had the good and catholic taste which embraced in its
appreciations, and with like geniality, old wine, as well as
old books. He was less wise in nourishing a great dislike
to cool breezes. ‘Shut the door,’ was usually his first
greeting to any visitant who had to introduce himself to the
Doctor’s notice; and it was a joke against him, in his later
days, that the same words were his parting salutation to a
couple of highwaymen who had taken his purse as he was
journeying homewards in his carriage, and who were
adding cruelty to robbery by exposing him to the fresh air
when they made off.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Choice Books in Burney’s Library.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Some of Dr. <span class='sc'>Burney’s</span> choicest books were obtained
when the Pinelli Library was brought to England from
Italy. The prime ornament of his manuscript Collection, a
thirteenth century copy of the <cite>Iliad</cite>, of great beauty and
rich in scholia, was bought at the sale of the fine Library of
Charles <span class='sc'>Towneley</span>, Collector of the Marbles.</p>

<p class='c011'>Although classical literature was the strength of the
<span class='sc'>Burney</span> Collection, it was also rich in some other departments.
Of English newspapers, for example, he had
brought together nearly seven hundred volumes of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, reaching from the
reign of <span class='sc'>James the First</span> to the reign of <span class='sc'>George the
Third</span>. No such assemblage had been theretofore formed,
I think, by any Collector. He had also amassed nearly four
hundred volumes containing materials for a history of the
British Stage, which materials have subsequently been
largely used by Mr. <span class='sc'>Genest</span>, in his work on that subject.
For <span class='sc'>Burney’s</span> life-long study of the Greek drama had gradually
inspired him with a desire to trace what, in a sense,
may be termed its modern revival, in the grand sequel
given to it by <span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span> and his contemporaries. He
had also collected about five thousand engraved theatrical
portraits, and two thousand portraits of literary personages.</p>

<p class='c011'>A large number of his printed books contained marginal
manuscript notes by <span class='sc'>Bentley</span>, <span class='sc'>Casaubon</span>, <span class='sc'>Burmann</span>, and
other noted scholars. And in a series of one hundred and
seventy volumes <span class='sc'>Burney</span> had himself collected all the
extant remains and fragments of Greek dramatic writers—about
three hundred in number. These remains he had
arranged under the collective title of <cite><span lang="co" xml:lang="co">Fragmenta Scenica
Græca</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c011'>A splendid vellum manuscript of the Greek orators,
in scription of the fourteenth century, had been obtained
from Dr. <span class='sc'>Clarke</span>, by whom it had been acquired during
Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin’s</span> Ottoman Embassy, and brought into England.
It supplied lacunæ which are found wanting in all other
known manuscripts. It completed an imperfect oration of
<cite>Lycurgus</cite>, and another of <cite>Dinarchus</cite>. Another MS. of the
Greek orators, of the fifteenth century, is only next in value
to that derived from <span class='sc'>Clarke’s</span> researches in the East, of
1800. There is also a very fine manuscript of the Geography
of <span class='sc'>Ptolemy</span>, with maps compiled in the fifteenth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>century, and two very choice copies of the Greek <cite>Gospels</cite>,
one of which is of the tenth, and the other of the twelfth
centuries.</p>

<p class='c011'>In Latin classics, the <span class='sc'>Burney</span> Manuscripts include a
fourteenth century <cite>Plautus</cite>, containing no fewer than twenty
plays—whereas a manuscript containing even twelve plays
has long been regarded as a rarity. A fifteenth century
copy of the mathematical tracts collected by <span class='sc'>Pappus Alexandrinus</span>,
a <cite>Callimachus</cite> of the same date, and a curious
Manuscript of the <cite>Asinus Aureus</cite> of <span class='sc'>Apuleius</span>, are also
notable. The whole number of Classical Manuscripts which
this Collector had brought together was stated, at the time
of his death, to be three hundred and eighty-five.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Burney</span> died on the twenty-eighth of December,
1817, having just entered upon his sixty-first year. He was
buried at Deptford, amidst the lamentations of his parishioners
at his loss.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Doctor Burney’s Character.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>For in <span class='sc'>Burney</span>, too, the scholar and the Collector had
not been suffered to dwarf or to engross the whole man.
His parishioners assembled, soon after his death, to evince
publicly their sense of what Death had robbed them of.
The testimony then borne to his character was far better,
because more pertinent, laudation, than is usually met with
in the literature of tombstones. Those who had known the
man intimately then said of him: ‘His attainments in learning
were united with equal generosity and kindness of heart.
His impressive discourses from the pulpit became doubly
beneficial from the influence of his own example.’ The
parishioners agreed to erect a monument to his memory,
‘as a record of their affection for their revered pastor,
monitor, and friend; of their gratitude for his services, and
of their unspeakable regret for his loss.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>Another meeting was called shortly afterwards, with a
like object, but of another sort. Despite his reverence for
Busbeian traditions, Dr. <span class='sc'>Burney</span> had known how to win
the love of his pupils.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Annual
Biography
and Obituary</cite>,

A large body of them met, under
the chairmanship of the excellent John <span class='sc'>Kaye</span>, then Regius
Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, and afterwards Bishop
of Lincoln, and they subscribed for the placing of a monument
to their old master in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The application of the Trustees of the British Museum to Parliament for the purchase of Burney’s Library.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>On the twenty-third of February, 1818, the Trustees of
the British Museum presented to the House of Commons
a petition, praying that Dr. <span class='sc'>Burney’s</span> Library should be
acquired for the Public. The prayer of the petition was
supported by Mr. <span class='sc'>Bankes</span> and by Mr. <span class='sc'>Vansittart</span>, and
a Select Committee was appointed to inquire and report
upon the application.</p>

<p class='c011'>In order to an accurate estimate of the value of the
Library, a comparison was instituted, in certain particulars,
between its contents and those of the Collection already in
the national Museum. In comparing the works of a series
of twenty-four Greek authors, it was found that of those
authors, taken collectively, the Museum possessed only two
hundred and thirty-nine several editions, whereas Dr.
Charles <span class='sc'>Burney</span> had collected no fewer than seven hundred
and twenty-five editions.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c013'><sup>[6]</sup></a>

His Collection of the Greek
dramatists was not only, as I have said, extensive, but it
was arrayed after a peculiar and interesting manner. By
making a considerable sacrifice of duplicate copies, he had
brought his series of editions into an order which exhibited,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>at one view, all the diversities of text, recension, and
commentary. His Greek grammarians were arrayed in
like manner. And his collection of lexicographers generally,
and of philologists, was both large and well selected.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><cite>Report of Select Committee</cite>, 1818; passim.</div>

<p class='c011'>The total number of printed books was nearly thirteen
thousand five hundred volumes, that of manuscripts was
five hundred and twenty; and the total sum given for
the whole was thirteen thousand five hundred pounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was estimated that the Collection had cost Dr. <span class='sc'>Burney</span>
a much larger sum, and that, possibly, if sold by public
auction, it might have produced to his representatives more
than twenty thousand pounds.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the same year with the acquisition of the Burney
Library, the national Collections were augmented by the
purchase of the printed books of a distinguished Italian
scholar long resident in France, and eminent for his contributions
to French literature.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Collection

of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire Littéraire d’Italie</span></cite> and a conspicuous
contributor to the early volumes of the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biographie Universelle</span></cite>—had
brought together a good Collection of Italian, French,
and Classical literature. It comprised, amongst the rest,
the materials which had been gathered for the book by
which the Collector is now chiefly remembered, and extended,
in the whole, to more than four thousand three
hundred separate works, of which number nearly one thousand
seven hundred related to Italian literature, or to its
history. This valuable Collection was obtained by the
Trustees—owing to the then depressed state of the
Continental book-market—for one thousand pounds. And,
in point of literary value, it may be described as the first—in
point of price, as the cheapest—of a series of purchases
which now began to be made on the Continent.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>A more numerous printed Library had been purchased
together with a cabinet of coins and a valuable herbarium,
at Munich, three years earlier, at the sale of the Collections
of Baron <span class='sc'>Von Moll</span>. His Library exceeded fourteen
thousand volumes, nearly eight thousand of which related
to the physical sciences and to cognate subjects.

<p class='c011'>These successive purchases, together with the Hargrave
Collection—acquired in 1813—increased the theretofore
much neglected Library by an aggregate addition of nearly
thirty-five thousand volumes. And for four successive
years (1812–15) Parliament made a special annual grant
of one thousand pounds<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c013'><sup>[8]</sup></a> for the purchase of printed books
relating to British History.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Francis Hargrave and his Collections in Law Literature.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The peculiar importance of the Hargrave Collection
consisted in its manuscripts and its annotated printed
books. The former were about five hundred in number,
and were works of great juridical weight and authority,
not merely the curiosities of black-letter law. Their Collector
was the most eminent parliamentary lawyer of his
day, but his devotion to the science of law had, to some
degree, impeded his enjoyment of its sweets. During
some of the best years of his life he had been more intent
on increasing his legal lore than on swelling his legal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>profits. And thus the same legislative act which enriched
the Museum Library, in both of its departments, helped to
smooth the declining years of a man who had won an
uncommon distinction in his special pursuit. Francis
<span class='sc'>Hargrave</span> died on the sixteenth of August, 1821, at the
age of eighty.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Egerton Bequest.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Leaving now this not very long list of acquisitions made
by the National Library, in the way of purchase, either at
the public cost or from endowments, we have again to turn
to a new and conspicuous instance of private liberality.
Like <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span>, and like <span class='sc'>Burney</span>, Francis Henry
<span class='sc'>Egerton</span> belonged to a profession which at nearly all periods
of our history—though in a very different degree in different
ages—has done eminent honour and rendered large services
to the nation, and that in an unusual variety of paths.</p>

<p class='c011'>Each of these three clergymen is now chiefly remembered
as a ‘Collector.’ Each of them would seem to have
been placed quite out of his true element and sphere of
labour, when assuming the responsibilities of a priest in
the Church of England. <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span> was scarcely more
fitted for the work, at all events, of a preacher—save by
the tacit lessons of a most meek and charitable life—than
he was fitted to head a cavalry charge on the field of battle.
<span class='sc'>Burney</span> was manifestly cut out by nature for the work of
a schoolmaster; although, as we have seen, he was able—late,
comparatively, in life—so to discharge (for a very few
years) the duties of a parish priest as to win the love of
his flock. <span class='sc'>Egerton</span> was unsuited to clerical work of
almost any and every kind. Yet he, too, with all his eccentricities
and his indefensible absenteeism, became a public
benefactor. The last act of his life was to make a provision
which has been fruitful in good, having a bearing—very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>real though indirect—upon the special duties of the priestly
function, for which he was himself so little adapted. The
bequests of Francis <span class='sc'>Egerton</span> had, among their many
useful results, the enabling of Thomas <span class='sc'>Chalmers</span> to add
one more to his fruitful labours for the Christian Church
and for the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may not, I trust, be out of place to notice in this
connection, and as one among innumerable debts which
our country owes specifically to its Church Establishment,
the impressive and varied way in which the English Church
has, at every period, inculcated the lesson (by no means, nowadays,
a favourite lesson of ‘the age’) that men owe duties
to posterity, as well as duties to their contemporaries.
The fact bears directly on the subject of this book. Into
every path of life many men must needs enter, from time
to time, without possessing any peculiar and real fitness
for it. In a path which (in the course of successive ages)
has been trodden by some millions of men, there must
needs have been a crowd of incomers who had been better
on the outside. They were like the square men who get
to be thrust violently into round holes. But, even of these
misplaced men, not a few have learnt, under the teaching
of the Church, that if they could not with efficiency do
pulpit work or parish work, there was other work which
they could do, and do perpetually. Men, for example, who
loved literature could, for all time to come, secure for the
poorest student ample access to the best books, and to the
inexhaustible treasures they contain. <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span> did
this. <span class='sc'>Burney</span> helped to do it. <span class='sc'>Egerton</span> not only did the
like, in his degree, in several parts of England, but he enabled
other and abler men to write new books of a sort
which are conspicuously adapted to add to the equipment
of divines for their special duty and work in the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>Neglecting to learn many lessons which the Church teaches,
to her clergy as well as to laymen, he had at least learnt
one lesson of practical and permanent value.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hence it is that, in addition to the matchless roll of
English worthies which, in her best days, the Church has furnished—in
that long line of men, from her ranks, who
have done honour to her, and to England, under <em>every</em> point
of view—she can show a subsidiary list, comprising men
whose benefactions are more influential than were, or could
have been, the labours of their lives; men of the sort who,
being dead, can yet speak, and to much better purpose
than ever they could speak when alive. Among such is
the Churchman whose testamentary gifts have now very
briefly to be mentioned.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Life of Francis Henry Egerton, Earl of Bridgewater, and Founder of the ‘Bridgewater Treatises.’</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Francis Henry <span class='sc'>Egerton</span> was a younger son of John
<span class='sc'>Egerton</span>, Bishop of Durham, by the Lady Anna Sophia
<span class='sc'>Grey</span>, daughter and coheir of Henry <span class='sc'>Grey</span>, Duke of
Kent. He was born on the eleventh of November, 1756.
The Bishop of Durham was fifth in descent from the
famous Chancellor of England, Thomas <span class='sc'>Egerton</span>, Viscount
Brachley, to whom, as he lay upon his death-bed, <span class='sc'>Bacon</span>
came with the news of King <span class='sc'>James’s</span> promise to make him
an Earl. Before the patent could be sealed, the exchancellor,
it will be remembered, was dead, and <span class='sc'>James</span>,
to show his gratitude to the departed statesman, sold for a
large sum the Earldom of Bridgewater to the Chancellor’s
son. Eventually, of that earldom Francis Henry <span class='sc'>Egerton</span>
was, in his old age, the eighth and last inheritor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Egerton</span> was educated at Eton and at All Souls.
He took his M.A. in 1780, and in the following year was
presented, by his relative, Francis, Duke of <span class='sc'>Bridgewater</span>—the
father of inland navigation in Britain—to the Rectory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>of Middle, in Shropshire, a living which he held for
eight and forty years.</p>

<p class='c011'>He was a toward and good scholar. From his youth
he was a great reader and a lover of antiquities, as well as
a respectable philologist. His foible was an overweening
although a pardonable pride in his ancestry. That ancestry
embraced what was noblest in the merely antiquarian point
of view, along with the grand historical distinctions of state
service rendered to Queen <span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span>, and of a new element
introduced into the mercantile greatness of England
under <span class='sc'>George the Third</span>. A man may be forgiven for
being proud of a family which included the servant of
<span class='sc'>Elizabeth</span> and friend of <span class='sc'>Bacon</span>, as well as the friend of
<span class='sc'>Brindley</span>. But the pride, as years increased, became
somewhat wearisome to acquaintances; though it proved to
be a source of no small profit to printers and engravers,
both at home and abroad. Mr. <span class='sc'>Egerton’s</span> writings in
biography and genealogy are very numerous. They date
from 1793 to 1826. Some of them are in French. All of
them relate, more or less directly, to the family of <span class='sc'>Egerton</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the year 1796, he appeared as an author in another
department, and with much credit. His edition of the
<cite>Hippolytus</cite> of <span class='sc'>Euripides</span> is also noticeable for its modest
and candid acknowledgment of the assistance he had
derived from other scholars. He afterwards collected and
edited some fragments of the odes of <span class='sc'>Sappho</span>. The later
years of his life were chiefly passed in Paris. His mind
had been soured by some unhappy family troubles and
discords, and as years increased a lamentable spirit of
eccentricity increased with them. It had grown with his
growth, but did not weaken with his loss of bodily and
mental vigour.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>One of the most noted manifestations of this eccentricity
was but the distortion of a good quality. He had a fondness
for dumb animals. He could not bear to see them
suffer by any infliction,—other than that necessitated by
a love of field sports, which, to an Englishman, is as
natural and as necessary as mother’s milk. At length, the
Parisians were scandalised by the frequent sight of a carriage,
full of dogs, attended with as much state and solemnity
as if it contained ‘milord’ in person. To his
servants he was a most liberal master. He provided largely
for the parochial service and parochial charities of his two
parishes of Middle and Whitchurch (both in Shropshire).
He was, occasionally, a liberal benefactor to men of recondite
learning, such as meet commonly with small reward
in this world.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a> But much of his life was stamped with
the ineffaceable discredit of sacred functions voluntarily
assumed, yet habitually discharged by proxy.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the death, in 1823, of his elder brother—who had
become seventh Earl of <span class='sc'>Bridgewater</span>, under the creation
of 1617, on the decease of Francis third Duke and sixth
(Egerton) Earl—Francis Henry <span class='sc'>Egerton</span> became eighth
Earl of <span class='sc'>Bridgewater</span>. But he continued to live chiefly
in Paris, where he died, in April, 1829, at the age of
seventy-two years. With the peerage he had inherited a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>very large estate, although the vast ducal property in canals
had passed, as is well known, in 1803, to the <span class='sc'>Leveson-Gowers</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Part of Lord <span class='sc'>Bridgewater’s</span> leisure at Paris was given
to the composition of a largely-planned treatise on Natural
Theology. But the task was far above the powers of the
undertaker. He had made considerable progress, after his
fashion, and part of what he had written was put superbly
into type, from the press of <span class='sc'>Didot</span>. Very wisely, he
resolved to enable abler men to do the work more efficiently.
And this was a main object of his remarkable
Will.</p>

<p class='c011'>That portion of the document which eventually gave to
the world the well-known ‘Bridgewater Treatises’ of <span class='sc'>Chalmers</span>,
<span class='sc'>Buckland</span>, <span class='sc'>Whewell</span>, <span class='sc'>Prout</span>, <span class='sc'>Roget</span>, and their
fellows in the task, reads thus:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Lord Bridgewater’s Bequests for the preparation of Treatises on Natural Theology.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>‘I give and bequeath to the President of the Royal
Society the sum of eight thousand pounds, to be applied
according to the order and direction of the said President
of the Royal Society, in full and without any diminution
or abatement whatsoever, in such proportions and at such
times, according to his discretion and judgment, and without
being subject to any control or responsibility whatsoever, to
such person or persons as the said President for the time
being of the aforesaid Royal Society shall or may nominate
or appoint and employ. And it is my will and particular
request that some person or persons be nominated
and appointed by him to write, print, publish, and expose
to public sale, one thousand copies of a work “<cite>On
Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in
the Creation</cite>,” illustrating such work by all reasonable arguments;
as, for instance, the variety and formation of God’s
creatures, in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>the effect of digestion, and thereby of conversion; the construction
of the hand of man, and an infinite variety of
arrangements; as also by discoveries, ancient and modern,
in arts, sciences, and in the whole extent of literature. And
I desire that the profits arising from and out of the circulation
and sale of the aforesaid work shall be paid by the said
President of the said Royal Society, as of right, as a further
remuneration and reward to such persons as the said President
shall or may so nominate, appoint, and employ as
aforesaid. And I hereby fully authorise and empower the
said President, in his own discretion, to direct and cause to
be paid and advanced to such person or persons during
the printing and preparing of the said work the sum of
three hundred pounds, and also the sum of five hundred
pounds sterling to the same person or persons during the
printing and preparing of the said work for the press, out
of, and in part of, the same eight thousand pounds sterling.
And I will and direct that the remainder of the said sum
of eight thousand pounds sterling, or of the stocks or funds
wherein the same shall have been invested, together with
all interest, dividend, or dividends accrued thereon, be
transferred, assigned, and paid over to such person or persons,
their or his executors, administrators, or assigns, as
shall have been so nominated, appointed, and employed by
the said President of the said Royal Society, at the instance
and request of the same President, as and when he shall
deem the object of this bequest to have been fully complied
with by such person or persons so nominated,
appointed, and employed by him as aforesaid.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Bequests of Lord Bridgewater to the British Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>What was done by the Trustees under this part of Lord
<span class='sc'>Bridgewater’s</span> Will, and with what result, is known to all
readers. That other portion of the Will which relates to
his bequest to the British Museum reads thus:—‘I give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>and bequeath to the Trustees for the time being of the
<em>British Museum</em> at Montagu House, in London, to be there

<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>under the particular care, superintendence, and direction
of Eugene Auguste <span class='sc'>Barbier</span>, one of my Trustees and
Executors hereinafter appointed; for which particular service
I give and bequeath to him, the said Eugene Auguste
<span class='sc'>Barbier</span>, the sum of two thousand pounds sterling. I
also give, bequeath, and demise unto the said Trustees of
the <em>British Museum</em> all my estate, lands, parcels of land,
ground, hereditaments and appurtenances, situate in the
parish of <em>Whitchurch-cum-Marbury</em>, or in any other parish

which now belong to me by right of purchase, descent, or
otherwise, to have and to hold the same estate, lands, parcels

the said Trustees of the said <em>British Museum</em> for the time

so as to promote the growth of the larger trees; and
that the same estate, lands, parcels of land, ground, hereditaments
and appurtenances, seats, sittings or pews, or any

upon further trust that they the said Trustees of the British

the rents, issues, and profits which shall from time to time
arise from and out of the said estate, lands, parcels of land,

that my said Trustees hereinafter appointed, within the

<em>British Museum</em> for the time being, or in such names and
for such account as the said Trustees shall direct, the sum of
seven thousand pounds sterling, the interest and dividends
whereof, as the same shall from time to time become due
and payable, I desire and direct shall and may be paid over

my said Collection of Manuscripts
so deposited in the <em>British Museum</em> as aforesaid, in the
most advantageous manner, according to their judgment
and discretion.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The eccentricity of which I have spoken showed itself in
the successive changes of detail and other modifications
which these bequests underwent before the testator’s death.
What with the Will and its many codicils, the documents,
collectively, came to be of a kind which might task the acumen
of a <span class='sc'>Fearne</span> or a St. <span class='sc'>Leonards</span>. But the drift of the
Will was undisturbed. The restrictions as to the underletting
of the Whitchurch estate, and the like, were now
limited by codicils to a prescribed term of years after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>the testator’s death; power was given to the Museum
Trustees to sell, also after a certain interval, the landed estate
bequeathed for the purchase of manuscripts, should it be
deemed conducive to the interest of the Library so to do;
and an additional sum of five thousand pounds was given
to the Trustees for the further increase of the Collection
of Manuscripts, and for the reward of its keeper, in lieu of
the residuary interest in the testator’s personal estate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><cite>Minutes of Trustees</cite>; (printed in Parliamentary Paper of 1835–6).</div>

<p class='c011'>On the 10th of March, 1832, the Trustees resolved that
the yearly proceeds of the last-named bequest should be
paid to the Librarians in charge of the MSS., but that their
ordinary salaries, on the establishment, should be diminished
by a like amount.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Character of the Egerton MSS.</span>;</div>

<p class='c011'>The Manuscripts bequeathed by Lord <span class='sc'>Bridgewater</span>
comprise a considerable collection of the original letters of
the Kings, Queens, Statesmen, Marshals, and Diplomatists,
of France; another valuable series of original letters and
papers of the authors and scientific men of France and of
Italy; many papers of Italian Statesmen; and a portion of
the donor’s own private correspondence. The latter series
of papers includes, amongst others, letters by Andres,
D’Ansse de Villoisin, the Prince of Aremberg, Auger,
Barbier, the Duke of Blacas, Bodoni, Boissonade, Bonpland,
Canova, Cuvier, Ginguené, Humboldt, Valckenaer, and
Visconti. Some of these are merely letters of compliment.
Others—and, in an especial degree, those of D’Ansse de
Villoisin, of Boissonade, of Ginguené, of Humboldt, and of
Visconti—contain much interesting matter on questions of
archæology, art, and history.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>and of the Additions made to it from 1832 to 1870.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The earliest additions to the Egerton Collection were
made by the Trustees in May, 1832. In the selection of
MSS. for purchase the Trustees, with great propriety, have
given a preference—on the whole; not exclusively—to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>class of documents of which the donor’s own Collection was
mainly composed—the materials, namely, of Continental
history. Amongst the earliest purchases of 1832 was
a curious Venetian <em>Portolano</em> of the fifteenth century.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Hardiman
MSS.
on Irish
Archæology
and
English
History.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In
the same year a large series of Irish Manuscripts, collected
by the late John <span class='sc'>Hardiman</span>, was acquired. This extends
from the Egerton number ‘74’ to ‘214’; and from the
same Collector was obtained the valuable <cite>Minutes of
Debates in the House of Commons</cite>, taken by Colonel
<span class='sc'>Cavendish</span>, between the years—so memorable in our
history—from 1768 to 1774.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c013'><sup>[10]</sup></a> In the year 1835, a large
collection of manuscripts illustrative of Spanish history was
purchased from Mr. <span class='sc'>Rich</span>, a literary agent in London, and
another large series of miscellaneous manuscripts—historical,
political, and literary—from the late bookseller, Thomas
<span class='sc'>Rodd</span>. From the same source another like collection was
obtained in 1840. An extensive series of French State
Papers was acquired (by the agency of Messrs. <span class='sc'>Barthes</span>
and <span class='sc'>Lowell</span>) in 1843; and also, in that year, a collection
of Persian MSS. In the following year a curious series of
drawings, illustrating the antiquities, manners, and customs
of China, was obtained; and, in 1845, another valuable
series of French historical manuscripts.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, the example set by Lord <span class='sc'>Bridgewater</span> had
incited one of those many liberal-minded Trustees of the
British Museum who have become its benefactors by augmentation,
as well as by faithful guardianship, to follow it
in exactly the same track.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Augmentation
of
Lord
Bridgewater’s
Gift by
that of
Lord Farnborough,
1838.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Charles <span class='sc'>Long</span>, Lord Farnborough,
bequeathed (in 1838) the sum of two thousand
eight hundred and seventy-two pounds in Three per cent.
Consols, specifically as an augmentation of the Bridgewater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>fund. Lord <span class='sc'>Farnborough’s</span> bequest now produces eighty-six
pounds a year; Lord <span class='sc'>Bridgewater’s</span>, about four
hundred and ninety pounds a year. Together, therefore,
they yield five hundred and seventy pounds, annually, for
the improvement of the National Collection of Manuscripts.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1850 and 1852, an extensive series of German <cite>Albums</cite>—many
of them belonging to celebrated scholars—was
acquired. These are now ‘Egerton MSS. 1179’ to ‘1499,’
inclusive, and ‘1540’ to ‘1607.’ A curious collection of
papers relating to the Spanish Inquisition was also obtained
in 1850.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Egerton MSS.</cite>
1704–1756.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><em>Ib.</em> 1758–1772.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In 1857, the important historical collection,
known as ‘the Bentinck Papers,’ was purchased from Tycho
<span class='sc'>Mommsen</span>, of Oldenburgh. In the following year, another
series of Spanish State Papers, and also the Irish Manuscripts
of Henry <span class='sc'>Monck Mason</span>;—in 1860, a further
series of ‘Bentinck Papers,’—and in 1861, an extensive
collection of the Correspondence of <span class='sc'>Pope</span> and of Bishop
<span class='sc'>Warburton</span>, were successively acquired.</p>

<p class='c011'>To these large accumulations of the materials of history
were added, in the succeeding years, other important collections
of English correspondence, and of autograph MSS.
of famous authors; and also a choice collection of Spanish

The pen of a slanderer has
aimed at gaining a sort of celebrity, more enduring than
anything of its own proper production could hope to secure,
by attempting to affix on <span class='sc'>Byron</span> and on Augusta <span class='sc'>Leigh</span>—after
both the great poet and the affectionate sister have
lain many years in their several graves, and can no longer
rebut the slander—the stain of an enormous guilt. Some,
however, are yet alive, by whom the calumny <em>can</em>, and will,
be conclusively exposed. Meanwhile, the slanderer’s poor
aim will, probably, have been reached—but in an unexpected
and unenviable way.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Very happily, the calumniating pen was not held in any
English hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Much more might, and not unfitly, be said in illustration
of the historical and literary value of those manuscript
accessions to the National Library which, in these later years,
have accrued out of the proceeds of Lord <span class='sc'>Bridgewater’s</span>
gift. Enough, however, has been stated, to serve by way
of sample.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Other benefactions of Lord Bridgewater.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Nor were these the only literary bequests and foundations
of the last Earl of <span class='sc'>Bridgewater</span>. He bequeathed, as heir-looms,
two considerable Libraries, rich both in theology and
in history—to the respective rectors, for ever, of the
parishes of Middle and of Whitchurch. These, I learn—from
MS. correspondence now before me—are of great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>value, and are gladly made available, by their owners for
the time being, to the use of persons able and willing to
profit by them. He also founded a Library, likewise by
way of heirloom, at Ashridge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whilst the National Library was thus being gradually improved,
both by increased liberality on the part of Parliament
and, far more largely, by the munificent gifts of
individuals, other departments of the Museum had not been
neglected.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The acquisition of the Greville Minerals</span>;</div>

<p class='c011'>Charles <span class='sc'>Greville</span>, the nephew of Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>,
had collected, in his residence at Paddington Green, a
noble cabinet of minerals. It was the finest assemblage of
its kind which had yet been seen in England. For the
purchase of this Collection Parliament made a grant, in the
year 1810, of thirteen thousand seven hundred and twenty-seven
pounds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>of the Montagu Museum</span>; [See, hereafter, Book III, c. I.]</div>

<p class='c011'>In 1816, a valuable accession came to the zoological
department, by the purchase, for the sum of eleven hundred
pounds, of a Collection of British Zoology, which had been
formed at Knowle, in Devonshire, by Colonel George
<span class='sc'>Montagu</span>. The Montagu Collection was especially rich in
birds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>and of the Collections of Sir R. C. Hoare.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Nine years later, the Library was further benefited, in the
way of gift, by a choice Italian Collection, gathered and
given by Sir Richard Colt <span class='sc'>Hoare</span>, of Stourhead; and, in
the way of Parliamentary grant, by the acquisition of the
collection of manuscripts, coins, and other antiquities, which
had been made in the East, during his years of Consulship
at Baghdad, by Claudius James <span class='sc'>Rich</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Richard <span class='sc'>Hoare</span> was not less distinguished for the
taste and judgment with which he had collected the historical
literature of Italy, than for the zeal and ability with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>which he cultivated, both as author and as patron, the—in
Britain—too much neglected department of provincial topography.
He had spent nearly five years in Italy—partly
during the reign of <span class='sc'>Napoleon</span>—and amassed a very fine
collection of books illustrative of all departments of Italian
history. In 1825, Sir Richard presented this Collection to
the Trustees of the British Museum in these words:—‘Anxious
to follow the liberal example of our gracious
monarch <span class='sc'>George the Fourth</span>, of Sir George <span class='sc'>Beaumont</span>,
and of Richard Payne <span class='sc'>Knight</span> (though in a very humble
degree), I do give unto the British Museum my Collection
of Topography, made during a residence of five years
abroad; and hoping that the more modern publications may
be added to it hereafter.’ The Library so given included
about seventeen hundred and thirty separate works. Sir
Richard did something, himself, to secure the fulfilment of
the annexed wish, by adding to his first gift, made in 1825,
in subsequent years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Collections of Claudius Rich.</span> [See, hereafter, Book III, c. 3.]</div>

<p class='c011'>The researches of Claudius <span class='sc'>Rich</span> merit some special
notice. He may be regarded as the first explorer of Assyria.
Had it not been for his early death, it is very probable that
he might have anticipated some of the brilliant discoveries
of Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span>. But his quickly intercepted researches
will be best described, in connection with the later explorations
in the same field. Here it may suffice to say
that from Mr. <span class='sc'>Rich’s</span> representatives a Collection of Manuscripts,
extending to eight hundred and two volumes—Syriac,
Arabic, Persian, and Turkish—was obtained, by
purchase, in 1825, together with a small Collection of Coins
and miscellaneous antiquities.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the Oriental Manuscripts of <span class='sc'>Rich</span>, an important
addition was made in the course of the same year by the
bequest of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Hull’s Oriental
MSS.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Mr. John Fowler <span class='sc'>Hull</span>—another distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>Orientalist who passed from amongst us at an early age—who
also bequeathed a Collection of Oriental and Chinese
printed books. Mr. <span class='sc'>Hull’s</span> legacy was the small beginning
of that Chinese Library which has now become so
large.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Persepolitan Marbles.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>It was also in the year 1825 that Sir Gore <span class='sc'>Ouseley</span>
presented a Collection of Marbles obtained from Persepolis.
These will be mentioned hereafter in connection with the
antiquarian explorations of Claudius <span class='sc'>Rich</span> and his successors.
The donor of the Persepolitan Marbles died on
the eighteenth of November, 1844.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>History of ‘the Portland Vase.’</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In addition to these many liberal benefactions made
during the earlier years of the present century, a smaller
gift (virtually a gift, though in name a ‘deposit’) of the
same period claims brief notice, on account both of its
artistic value and of its curious history. I refer to that
exquisite monument of ancient art known, for many years,
as the ‘Barberini Vase,’ but now more commonly as the
‘Portland Vase,’ from the name of its last individual
possessor.</p>

<p class='c011'>This vase is one of the innumerable acquisitions which
the country owes to the intelligent research and cultivated
taste of Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>. It had been found more
than a century before his time (probably in the year 1640),
beneath the Monte del Grano, about three miles from
Rome, on the road to Tusculum. The place of the discovery
was a sepulchral chamber, within which was found a
sarcophagus containing the vase, and bearing an inscription
to the memory of the Emperor <span class='sc'>Alexander Severus</span> (<em>A.D.</em>
222–235) and to his mother. About this sarcophagus and
its inscription there have been dissertations and rejoinders,
essays and commentaries, illustrative and obscurative, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>sufficient number to immortalise half a dozen Jonathan
<span class='sc'>Oldbucks</span> and ‘Antigonus’ <span class='sc'>Mac-Cribbs</span>. And the controversy
is still undetermined.</p>

<p class='c011'>After having been long a conspicuous ornament of the
Barberini Palace, the ‘Barberini Vase’ was bought by
<span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>. When, in December, 1784, he paid one of his
visits to England, the vase came with him. Its fame had
previously excited the desires of many virtuosi. By the
Duchess of <span class='sc'>Portland</span> it was so strongly coveted, that she
employed a niece of Sir William to conduct a negotiation
with much more solemnity and mystery than the ambassador
would have thought needful in conducting a critical Treaty
of Peace.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Correspondence
of Mrs.
Delany</cite>, vol.
ii (in many
places).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Duchess’s precautions foiled the curiosity of
not a few of her fellow-collectors in virtû. ‘I have heard,’
wrote Horace <span class='sc'>Walpole</span>, ‘that Sir W. <span class='sc'>Hamilton’s</span> renowned
vase, which had disappeared with so much mystery,
is again recovered; not in the tomb, but the treasury, of
the Duchess of <span class='sc'>Portland</span>, in which, I fancy, it had made
ample room for itself. Sir William told me it would never
go out of England. I do not see how he could warrant
<em>that</em>. The Duchess and Lord Edward have both shown how
little stability there is in the riches of that family.’

Lady Upper-Ossory,
10
August, 1785.
(Cunn. Edit.,
vol. ix, p. 3.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
As yet,
the reader will remember, that ‘Portland Estate,’ which
was so profitably to turn farms into streets, was but in
expectancy.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then <span class='sc'>Walpole</span> adds: ‘<em>My</em> family has felt how
insecure is the permanency of heir-looms,’—the thought of
that grand ‘Houghton Gallery,’ and its transportation to
Russia, coming across his memory, whilst telling Lady
<span class='sc'>Upper-Ossory</span> the story of the coveted vase, just imported
from the Barberini Palace at Rome.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Duchess of <span class='sc'>Portland</span> enjoyed the sight of her
beautiful purchase only during a few weeks. It was bought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>in by the family (at the nominal price of £1029<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a>) at the
sale of her famous museum of curiosities—a sale extending
to more than four thousand lots—and twenty-four years
afterwards, it was lent, for exhibition (1810), by the third
Duke of <span class='sc'>Portland</span>, to the Trustees of the British Museum,
where it has since remained.</p>

<p class='c011'>When <span class='sc'>Wedgwood</span> set about imitating the Portland
Vase in his manufactory at Etruria—for which purpose the
then Duke liberally lent it to him—he discovered that the
vase had been broken and skilfully put together again.
After it had been publicly exhibited during almost thirty-five
years in London, the frenzy of a maniac led—as it
seemed at the moment—to its utter destruction. But,
mainly by the singular skill and patience of the late John
<span class='sc'>Doubleday</span> (a craftsman attached to the Department of
Antiquities for many years), it was soon restored to its pristine
beauty. That one act of violence in 1845 is the only
instance of very serious injury arising from open exhibition
to all comers which the annals of the Museum record.</p>

<span class='sc'>George the Third</span>.—<em>His Conversations with Men
of Letters.—History of his Library and of its Transfer
to the British Nation by</em> <span class='sc'>George the Fourth</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>The strong antagonisms in mind, in disposition, and in
tastes, which existed between <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> and
<span class='sc'>George the Fourth</span>, may be seen in the small and incidental
acts of their respective lives, almost as distinctly, and
as sharply defined, as they are seen in their private lives, or
in their characteristic modes of transacting the public
business.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Contrasts
between
George III
and George
IV.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>George the Third</span> regretted the giving away
of the old ‘Royal Library’ of the Kings his ancestors, not
because he grudged a liberal use of royal books by private
scholars, but because he thought a fine Library was the
necessary appendage of a palace. He occasionally stinted
himself of some of his personal enjoyments in life, in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>to have the more means to amass books. He formed,
during his own lifetime, a Library which is probably both
larger and finer than any like Collection ever made by any
one man, even under the advantageous conditions of
royalty. When he had collected his books, he made them
liberally accessible. To himself, as we all know, Nature had
not given any very conspicuous faculty for turning either
books or men to good account; nor had education done
much to improve the parts he possessed.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>George the Fourth</span>, as it seems, regretted the formation
of the new Royal Library by the King his father,
because, when he inherited it, he found that its decent
maintenance and upkeeping would demand every year a
sum of money which he could spend in ways far more to
his taste. He had been far better educated than his father
had been. And to him Nature had given good abilities;
but study was about the last and least likely use to which,
at any time, he was inclined to apply them. If he saw any
good at all in having, on his accession, the ownership of a
large Library, it lay, not in the power it afforded him of
benefiting literature, and the labourers in literature, but in
the possibility he saw that so fine a collection of books
might be made to produce a round sum of money. One
of his first thoughts about the matter was, that it would be
a good thing to offer his father’s beloved Library for sale—to
the Emperor of Russia. By what influences that shrewd
scheme of turning a penny was diverted will be seen in
the sequel.</p>

<p class='c010'>If <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> was, in respect to his parts, only
slenderly endowed, he had in another respect large gifts.
Both his industry and his power of sustained application
were uncommon. And his conscientious sense of responsibility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>for the use of such abilities as he had was no less
remarkable. Whatever may have been his mistakes in
government, no man ever sat on the British throne who
was more thoroughly honest in his intentions, or more
deeply anxious to show, in the discharge of his duties, his
consciousness of being</p>

      <div class='line'>‘Ever in his great taskmaster’s eye.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>That his public acts did not more adequately correspond
with his good desires was due, in large measure, to an
infelicitous parentage and a narrow education.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the father of lies sometimes speaks truth, so a mere
party manifesto may sometimes give sound advice, though
clothed in a discreditable garb.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The education
of
George III,
after the
death of
Frederick,
Prince of
Wales.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When public attention
came first to be attracted to the character of the peculiar
influences which began to mould the training of the young
Prince of <span class='sc'>Wales</span> soon after his father’s death, a Court
Chamberlain received, one morning, by the post, an unsigned
document, which he thought it his duty to place in the
hands of the Prime Minister, and he, when he had read it,
thought the paper important enough to be laid before the
King. This anonymous memorial denounced, as early as in
the winter of 1752 (when the Prince was but fourteen years
old), the sort of education which <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> was
receiving as being likely to initiate an unfortunate reign.</p>

<p class='c011'>The paper (which I have now before me) is headed:
‘<cite>A Memorial of several Noblemen and Gentlemen of the first
rank</cite>,’ and in the course of it there is an assertion—as being
already matter of public notoriety—‘that books inculcating
the worst maxims of government, and defending the most
avowed tyrannies, have been put into the hands of the Prince
of Wales,’ and such a fact, it is said, ‘cannot but affect the
memorialists with the most melancholy apprehensions when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>they find that the men who had the honesty and resolution
to complain of such astonishing methods of instruction are
driven away from Court, and the men who have dared to
teach such doctrines are continued in trust and favour.’<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c013'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><cite>A Memorial</cite>, &amp;c.; MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span> 6271, fol. 3.</div>

<p class='c011'>Making all allowance for partisan feeling and for that
tinge of Whig oligarchism which peeps out, as well in the
very title, as in the contents of this ‘Memorial,’ there was
obvious truth in the denunciation, and a modicum of true
prophecy in the inference. But such a remonstrance had
just as little effect, in the way of checking undue influences,
as it had of wisdom in the form given to it, or in the mode
of its presentation at Court.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Narrow range of George the Third’s tastes for books.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The Prince’s education was not merely imbued with
ideas and maxims little likely to conduce towards a prosperous
reign. It was intellectually narrow and mean. He
grew up, for example, in utter ignorance of many of the
great lights of English literature. In respect to all books,
save one (that, happily, the greatest of all), he became one
of those who, through life, draw from the small cisterns,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>instead of going to the deep wells. He seems to have
been trained to think that the literary glories of his country
began with the age of Queen <span class='sc'>Anne</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In after-years, <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> attained to some dim
consciousness of his own narrowness of culture. The ply,
however, had been too early taken to be got rid of. No
training, probably, could have made him a scholar. But
his powers of application under wise direction would have
opened to him stores of knowledge, from which unwise
influences shut him out for life. His faculty of perseverance
in study, it must be remembered, was backed by thorough
honesty of nature, and by an ability to withstand temptations.
When he was entering his nineteenth year, a sub-preceptor,
who had watched him sedulously, said of him:
‘He is a lad of good principle. He has no heroic strain,
and no turn for extravagance. He loves peace, and, as
yet, has shown very virtuous principles. He has the
greatest temptation to gallant with ladies, who lay themselves
out in the most shameless manner to draw him on,
but to no purpose.’ Certainly this last characteristic was
neither an inherited virtue nor an ancestral tradition. And
it stands in curious contrast with the tendencies of all
his brothers and of almost all his sons.</p>

<p class='c011'>From youth upwards the Prince read much, though
he did not read wisely. No sooner was he King than he
began to set about the collection of his noble Library.
In the choice of a librarian he was not infelicitous, though
the selection was in part dictated by a feeling of brotherly
kindness. For he chose a very near relative—Mr. afterwards
Sir Frederick Augusta <span class='sc'>Barnard</span>. Mr. <span class='sc'>Barnard</span> had
many qualities which fitted him for his task.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Foundation of the New Royal Library.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The foundation of the Library was laid by a very fortunate
purchase on the Continent. Its increase was largely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>promoted by a political revolution which ensued shortly
afterwards; and, in order to turn his large opportunities to
most account, the King’s Librarian modestly sought and instantly
obtained the best advice which that generation could
afford him—the advice of Samuel <span class='sc'>Johnson</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1762, the fine Library of Joseph <span class='sc'>Smith</span>, who had
been British Consul at Venice during many years, was
bought for the King. It cost about ten thousand pounds.
<span class='sc'>Smith</span> had ransacked Italy for choice books, much as his
contemporary, Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>, had ransacked that
country for choice vases. And he had been not less successful
in his quest. In amassing early and choice editions
of the classics, and also the curiosities and rarities of
fifteenth century printing, he had been especially lucky.
From the same source, but at a later date, <span class='sc'>George the
Third</span> also obtained a fine gallery of pictures and a collection
of coins and gems. For these he gave twenty thousand
pounds.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Dactyliotheca
Smithiana</cite>;
1767; Lady
M. W.
Montagu,
<cite>Letters</cite>,
vol. iii, p. 89.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For seven or eight years the shops and
warehouses of English booksellers were also sedulously
examined, and large purchases were made from them. In
this labour <span class='sc'>Johnson</span> often assisted, actively, as well as by
advice.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the suppression of the Jesuits in many parts of
Europe made the literary treasures which that busy Society
had collected—often upon a princely scale and with admirable
taste, so far as their limitations permitted—both the
King and his librarian were struck with the idea that
another fine opportunity opened itself for book-buying on
the Continent. It was resolved that Mr. <span class='sc'>Barnard</span> should
travel for the purpose of profiting by it. Before he set
out on his journey, he betook himself to <span class='sc'>Johnson</span> for
counsel as to the best way of setting about the task.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Johnson’s</span> counsel may be thus abridged: The literature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>of every country may be best gathered on its native
soil. And the studies of the learned are everywhere influenced
by peculiarities of government and of religion. In
Italy you may, therefore, expect to meet with abundance of
the works of the Canonists and the Schoolmen; in Germany
with store of writers on the Feudal Laws; in Holland
you will find the booksellers’ shops swarming with the
works of the Civilians. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Substance
of
Johnson’s
advice on
the Collection
of
the King’s
Library.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Of Canonists a few of the most
eminent will suffice. Of the Schoolmen a liberal supply
will be a valuable addition to the King’s Library. The
departments of Feudal and Civil Law you can hardly render
too complete. In the Feudal Constitutions we see the
origin of our property laws. Of the Civil Law it is not
too much to say that it is a regal study.</p>

<p class='c011'>In respect to standard books generally, continued <span class='sc'>Johnson</span>,
a Royal Library ought to have the earliest or most
curious edition, the most sumptuous edition, and also the
most useful one, which will commonly be one of the latest
impressions of the book. As to the purchase of entire
libraries in bulk, the Doctor inclined to think—even a century
ago—that the inconvenience would commonly almost
overbalance the advantage, on the score of the excessive
accumulation of duplicate copies.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then he added a remark which (long years afterwards)
Sir Richard Colt <span class='sc'>Hoare</span> profited by, and made a
source of profit to our National Museum. ‘I am told,’
said <span class='sc'>Johnson</span>, ‘that scarcely a village of Italy wants its
historian. And it will be of great use to collect, in every
place, maps of the adjacent country, and plans of towns,
buildings, and gardens. By this care you will form a
more valuable body of geography than could otherwise be
had.’</p>

<p class='c011'>On that point—as, indeed, on all the points about which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>he gave advice—<span class='sc'>Johnson’s</span> counsel bore excellent fruit.
The ‘body of geography’ contained in the Georgian Library
has never, I think, been surpassed in any one Collection
(made by a single Collector) in the world. It laid, substantially,
the foundation of the noble assemblage of charts
and maps which now forms a separate Department of the
Museum, under the able superintendence of Mr. Richard
Henry <span class='sc'>Major</span>, who has done much for the advancement of
geographical knowledge in many paths, but in none more
efficiently than in his Museum labours.</p>

<p class='c011'>Like good counsel was given to <span class='sc'>Barnard</span> by the great
lexicographer, in relation to the gathering of illustrated
books. He told the King’s Librarian that he ought to
seek diligently for old books adorned with woodcuts,
because the designs were often those of great masters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Johnson’s remark on modern illustrated books.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>When to this remark the Doctor added the words:
‘Those old prints are such as cannot be made by any artist
now living,’ he asserted what was undoubtedly true, if he
limited that high praise to the best class of the works of
which he was speaking. But his words carry in them also
an indirect testimony of honour to <span class='sc'>George the Third</span>. If,
in the century which has passed since Samuel <span class='sc'>Johnson</span>
discussed with Frederick <span class='sc'>Barnard</span> the wisest means of
forming a Royal Library, a great stride has been made by
the arts of design in Britain, a share of the merit belongs
to the patriotic old King. He was amongst the earliest in
his dominions to encourage British art with an open hand.
He was not only the founder of the Royal Academy, but
a most liberal patron to artists; and he did not limit his
patronage to those men alone who belonged to his own
Academy. If for a series of years the Royal Academy did
less for Art, and did its work in a more narrow spirit of
coterie than it ought to have done, the fault was not in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>founder. And, of late years, the Academy itself has, in
many ways, nobly vindicated its foundation and the aid it
has received from the Public. Towards the foundation
of the Academy, <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> gave, from his privy
purse, more than five thousand pounds. To many of its
members he was a genial friend, as well as a liberal patron.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many other institutions of public education shared his
liberality. Some generous benefactions which he gave to
the British Museum itself, in the earlier years of his reign,
have been mentioned already. But there were a crowd of
other gifts, both in the earlier and in the later years, of
which the limits of this volume at present forbid me to
make detailed mention.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Continental tour of Mr. <span class='sc'>Barnard</span> was very successful
as to its main object. He obtained such rich accessions
for the Library as raised it—especially in the various departments
of Continental history and literature—much
above all other Libraries in Britain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><cite>Bibliotheca Askeviana</cite> (1775). <cite>Literary Anecdotes of Eighteenth Century</cite>, vol. iv, p. 513 (183–).</div>

<p class='c011'>Within a few years of his return to England the very
choice Collection which had been formed by Dr. Anthony
<span class='sc'>Askew</span> came into the market. For this Library, in bulk,
the King offered <span class='sc'>Askew’s</span> representatives five thousand
pounds. They thought they could make more of the
Collection by an auction, but, in the event, obtained less
than four thousand pounds. The Askew Library extended
only to three thousand five hundred and seventy separate
printed works, but it contained a large proportion of rare
and choice books. The chief buyers at the sale were the
Duke of <span class='sc'>La Vallière</span> and (through the agency of <span class='sc'>De
Bure</span>) <span class='sc'>Lewis the Sixteenth</span>. The King of England
bought comparatively little, although on this occasion Mr.
<span class='sc'>Barnard</span> could scarcely have withholden his hand on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>score of the special injunctions which the King had formerly
laid down for his guidance in such public competitions.</p>

<p class='c011'>For it deserves to be remembered that <span class='sc'>George the
Third’s</span> conscientious thoughtfulness for other people led
him, early in his career as a Collector, to give to his
librarian a general instruction such as the servants of
wealthy Collectors rarely receive. ‘I do not wish you,’ he
said, ‘to bid either against a literary man who wants books
for study, or against a known Collector of small means.’
He was very free to bid, on the other hand, against a Duke
of <span class='sc'>Roxburghe</span> or an Earl <span class='sc'>Spencer</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The King’s kindness of nature was also shown in the
free access which he at all times afforded to scholars and
students in his own Library. To this circumstance we owe
some of the most interesting notices we have of his opinions
of authors and of books.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The old localities of the Georgian Library.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In the earliest years of the Royal Collectorship part of
the Library was kept in the old palace at Kew, which has
long since disappeared, the site of it being now a gorgeous
flower-bed. Afterwards, and on the acquisition for the
Queen, of Buckingham House,<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c013'><sup>[13]</sup></a> the chief part of the Collection
was removed to Pimlico, and arranged in the handsome
rooms of which a view appears, by way of vignette,
on the title-pages of the sumptuously printed catalogue
prepared by <span class='sc'>Barnard</span>. It was at Buckingham House that
<span class='sc'>Johnson’s</span> well-known conversation with the King took
place, in February, 1767.</p>

<p class='c011'>When <span class='sc'>Johnson</span> first began to use the Royal Collection it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>was still in its infancy. He was surprised both at its
extent and at the number of rare and choice books which
it already included. He had seen <span class='sc'>Barnard’s</span> assiduity,
and had helped him occasionally in his book-researches,
long prior to the tour of 1768. But it astonished him to
see that the King, within six or seven years, had gathered
so fine a Library as that which he saw in 1767. He became
a frequent visitor. The King, hearing of the circumstance,
desired his librarian to let him know when the literary
autocrat came again.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The interview at Buckingham House between George III and Dr. Johnson.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The King’s first questions were about the doings at
Oxford, whence, he had been told, Johnson had recently
returned. The Doctor expressed his inability to bestow
much commendation on the diligence then exhibited by the
resident scholars of the University in the way of any conspicuous
additions to literature.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1767, February.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Presently, the King put
to him the question, ‘And what are you about yourself?’
‘I think,’ was the answer—given in a tone more modest
than the strict sense of the words may import—‘that I
have already done my part as a writer.’ To which the
King rejoined, ‘I should think so too, had you not written
so well.’ After this happy retort, the King turned the conversation
on some recent theological controversies. About
that between <span class='sc'>Warburton</span> and <span class='sc'>Lowth</span> he made another
neat though obvious remark—‘When it comes to calling
names, argument, truly, is pretty well at an end.’ They
then passed in review many of the periodical publications
of the day, in the course of which His Majesty displayed
considerable knowledge of the chief books of that class,
both English and French.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Croker’s
<cite>Boswell</cite>, pp.
184–186.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He showed his characteristic
and kingly attention to minutiæ by an observation which
he made when <span class='sc'>Johnson</span> had praised an improved arrangement
of the contents of the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>—oblivious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>at the moment, that he had himself suggested the
change. ‘They have to thank Dr. <span class='sc'>Johnson</span> for that,’ said
the King.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another remark made by <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> during this
conversation deserves to be remembered. ‘I wish,’ said he,
‘that we could have a really well-executed body of British
Biography.’ This was a desideratum in the seventh year
of the old King, and it is a desideratum still in the thirty-fourth
year of his granddaughter. The reign of Queen <span class='sc'>Victoria</span>
was comparatively young when the late Mr. <span class='sc'>Murray</span>
first announced, not without some flourish of trumpets, a
forthcoming attempt at such a labour, but the little that
was said as to the precise plan and scope of the work then
contemplated, gave small promise of an adequate performance;
and hitherto there has been no performance at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The King’s conversation with Dr. Beattie</span>;</div>

<p class='c011'>Six years after the interview with <span class='sc'>Johnson</span>, another literary
conversation, of which we have a record, was held in
the Royal Library. But on this occasion the scene was
Kew. Dr. <span class='sc'>Beattie’s</span> fame is now a thing of the past.
There is still, however, some living interest in the account
of the talk between the author of <cite>The Minstrel</cite> and his
sovereign, held in 1773,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1773.

<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Forbes, <cite>Life

vol. i, pp. 347–354.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
about prayers occasional
and prayers <em>ex tempore</em>, and about the methods of
education adopted in the Scottish universities.</p>

<p class='c011'>The King’s least favourable—but not least characteristic—appearance,
as a talker on literary subjects, is made in
that conversation with Miss <span class='sc'>Burney</span>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>and with
Miss
Burney.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
in which he uttered
his often-quoted remark on <span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>:—‘Was there
ever such stuff as great part of <cite>Shakespeare</cite>—only one
must not say so?’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1785.
December.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The sense of the humorous seems in
<span class='sc'>George III</span> to have been wholly lacking. And some part
of the sadness of his life has probably a vital connexion
with that deficiency.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>In the last-mentioned conversation, the King evinced
considerable acquaintance with French literature. He shared,
to some extent, the then very general admiration for <span class='sc'>Rousseau</span>,
on whom he had bestowed more than one act of kindness
during the brief English exile of the author of <cite>Emile</cite>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>D’Arblay,
<cite>Diary</cite>, vol. ii,
pp. 395–398.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He shared, also, the common impression as to the absence
of gratitude in the brilliant Frenchman’s character. When
Miss <span class='sc'>Burney</span> told him that his own portrait had been seen
to occupy the most conspicuous place in <span class='sc'>Rousseau’s</span> living-room
after his return to France, the King was both surprised
and touched.</p>

<p class='c010'>Next after the large and choice acquisitions made for
the King’s Library on the Continent, some of its most conspicuous
and valuable literary treasures were acquired at
the several sales, in London, of the Libraries of James
<span class='sc'>West</span> (1773), of John <span class='sc'>Ratcliffe</span> (1776), and of Richard
<span class='sc'>Farmer</span> (1798). It was at the first of these sales that
<span class='sc'>George the Third</span> laid the foundation of his unequalled
series of the productions of the father of English printing.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>George the Third’s series of books from Caxton’s Press.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The <em>Caxtons</em> bought for the King at West’s sale included
the dearly prized <cite>Recuyell of the Histories of Troye</cite> (1472–1474?),
the <cite>Booke of the Chesse</cite> (1476?), the <cite>Canterbury
Tales</cite> of <span class='sc'>Chaucer</span> (1478?), the <cite>Dictes and Sayinges of the
Philosophers</cite> (1480), the <cite>Mirrour of the World</cite> (1481), the
<cite>Godfrey of Boloyne</cite> (1482), the <cite>Confessio Amantis</cite> (1483),
the <cite>Paris and Vienne</cite> (1485), and the <cite>Royal Booke</cite> (1487?).
Of these, the lowest in price was the <cite>Confessio</cite> of 1483,
which the King acquired for nine guineas, and the highest
in price was the <cite>Chaucer</cite> of 1478, which cost him forty-seven
pounds fifteen shillings.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the same sale, he also acquired another Caxton, which
has a peculiar interest. The King’s copy of the <cite>Troylus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>and Creside</cite> (probably printed in the year 1484) formerly
belonged</p>

      <div class='line'>‘To Her, most gentle, most unfortunate,</div>

<p class='c011'>Three years after the dispersion of <span class='sc'>West’s</span> Library came
that of the extraordinary Collection which had been made
by a Bermondsey ship-chandler, John <span class='sc'>Ratcliffe</span> by name.
This worthy and fortunate Collector has been said, commonly,
to have amassed his black-letter curiosities by buying
them, at so much a pound, over his counter.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c013'><sup>[14]</sup></a> But of such
windfalls no man has ever been so lucky as to have more
than a few.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>John Ratcliffe
of
Bermondsey
and his
curious Library.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
John <span class='sc'>Ratcliffe</span> was, like his King, a large
buyer at <span class='sc'>West’s</span> sale, and at many other sales, upon the
ordinary terms.</p>

<p class='c011'>By pains and perseverance he had collected of books
printed by <span class='sc'>Caxton</span> the extraordinary number of forty-eight.
No Collector ever surpassed, or even reached, that
number, except Robert <span class='sc'>Harley</span>, in whose days books that
are now worth three hundred pounds could, not infrequently,
be bought for much less than the half of three
hundred pence.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ratcliffe’s</span> forty-eight <em>Caxtons</em> produced at his sale
two hundred and thirty-six pounds. The King bought
twenty of them at an aggregate cost of about eighty-five
pounds. Amongst them were the <cite>Boethius</cite>, of 1478; the
<cite>Reynarde the Foxe</cite>, of 1481; the <cite>Golden Legende</cite>, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span><cite>Curial</cite>, both of 1484; and the <cite>Speculum Vitæ Christi</cite>,
probably printed in 1488. The <cite>Boethius</cite> is a fine copy,
and was obtained for four pounds six shillings. A few
years ago an imperfect copy of the same book brought
more than sixteen times that sum.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Gifts to the King’s Library.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Two others of the King’s <cite>Caxtons</cite> were the gift of Jacob
<span class='sc'>Bryant</span>. One of these is Ralph <span class='sc'>Lefevre’s</span> <cite>Recueil des
histoires de Troye</cite>, printed, probably, in 1476. The other
is the <cite>Doctrinal of Sapience</cite>, printed in 1489. This last-named
volume is on vellum, and is the only copy so printed
which is known to exist. A third Caxton volume was
bequeathed to <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> by Mr. <span class='sc'>Hewett</span>, of
Ipswich. This is the <cite>Æsop</cite> of 1484, and is the only extant
copy.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>George III
and the
Bibliomania.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was delivered to the King by Sir John <span class='sc'>Hewett</span>
and Mr. Philip <span class='sc'>Broke</span>, the legator’s executors. <span class='sc'>George
the Third</span> was very sensitive to the special triumphs of
collectorship, and would be sure to prize the <cite>Æsop</cite> all the
more for its attribute of uniqueness.</p>

<p class='c011'>A story in illustration of this specific tinge of the bibliomania
in our royal Collector was wont to be told by Sir
Walter <span class='sc'>Scott</span>, and is mentioned in his interesting obituary
notice of the King, printed in the <cite>Edinburgh Weekly
Journal</cite><a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c013'><sup>[15]</sup></a> immediately after the King’s death. According
to <span class='sc'>Scott</span>, <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> was fond of crowing a little
over his brother-collector, the Duke of <span class='sc'>Roxburghe</span>, on the
score that the royal copy of the famous <cite>Recuyell of the
Histories of Troye</cite> had a pre-eminence over the Roxburghe
copy. The pre-eminence was of a sort, indeed, to which no
one but a thorough-paced Collector would be sensible. For
it consisted in the ‘locking,’ or wrong imposing, of certain
pages, afterwards corrected at press. The fault, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>indicated priority of working off. But I do not find in
the King’s <cite>Recuyell</cite>—which now lies before me—the
peculiarity spoken of in the poet’s story. Such a fault
does exist in the Roxburghe copy, which now belongs to
the Duke of <span class='sc'>Devonshire</span>. Other and authenticated
anecdotes, however, are abundant, which suffice to show
the close knowledge of, and the keen interest in, his books,
by which <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> was characterised. It was a
still better trait in him that he found real pleasure in
knowing that the treasures and rarities of his Library
subserved the inquiries and studies of scholars. Nor did
he make narrow limitations. Men like <span class='sc'>Johnson</span> and
Bishop <span class='sc'>Horsley</span> profited by the Collection. So, too, did
men like <span class='sc'>Gibbon</span> and <span class='sc'>Priestley</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The total number of Caxton prints amassed by <span class='sc'>George III</span>
was thirty-nine. Of these three are in the Royal Library at
Windsor—namely, the <cite>Recueil</cite> (1476?), the <cite>Æsop</cite> (1484),
and the <cite>Doctrinal</cite> (1489).</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>George the Third’s appearance as an Author.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>To a keen enjoyment of the pleasures of collectorship,
the King added, in 1787, a passing taste of those of authorship.
As a Collector, the bibliomania did not engross
him. He had a delight in amassing fine plants as well as
fine books. The <em>Hortus Kewensis</em> (in both applications of
the term) was largely indebted to his liberality of expenditure
and to his far-spread research. He sent botanic missionaries
to the remotest parts of Asia, as well as to Africa.
He took the most cordial interest in those varied voyages of
discovery which—as I have observed in a former chapter—cast
so distinctive a lustre on his reign, and in consequence
of which such large additions were made to our natural
history collections, public and private. And he did much
to promote scientific agriculture, both by precept and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>example. It was as a practical agriculturist that the
King (under a slight veil of pseudonymity<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a>) made his bow
to the reading public by the publication of seven articles in
Arthur <span class='sc'>Young’s</span> useful and then well-known periodical,
the <cite>Annals of Agriculture</cite>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Those articles have a threefold aim. They inculcate the
wisdom, for certain soils, of an intermediate system of treatment
and of cropping, midway between the old routine
and the drill-husbandry, then of recent introduction; they
describe several new implements, introduced by <span class='sc'>Ducket</span> of
Esher and of Petersham; and they advocate an almost
entire rejection of fallows. They further describe a method,
also introduced by Farmer <span class='sc'>Ducket</span>, and then peculiar, of
destroying that farmer’s pest, couch-grass (<em>triticum repens</em>),
by trench-ploughing it deep into the ground, and contain
many other practical suggestions, some of which seem to
have been empirical, and others so good that they have
become trite.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the best service rendered by <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> to
the agricultural pursuits, of which he was so fond, was his
introduction of the Merino flocks, which became conspicuous
ornaments to the great and little parks at Windsor. Part
of the success which, for a time, attended the importation
of those choice Merino breeds was due to the zealous co-operation
of Lord <span class='sc'>Somerville</span> and of Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span>
[see the next chapter], but the King himself took a real
initiative in the matter; acquired real knowledge about it;
and deserved, by his personal efforts, the cognomen given
him (by some of those worthy farmers who used to attend
the annual sales at Windsor) of ‘the Royal Shepherd.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Illness of George III</span>;</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>The recreative pursuits, alike of the book-collector and
of the agriculturist, as well as the labours of the conscientious
monarch, were at length to be arrested by that
great calamity which, after clouding over some months of
the years of vigour, was destined to veil in thick gloom all
the
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1810.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
years of decline—the years when great public triumphs
and crushing family afflictions passed equally unnoted by
the recluse of Windsor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>And his death.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>When <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> died at Windsor Castle, on
the 29th of January, 1820, the public mourning was
sincere.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1820.
January.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
During its ten years of rule, the Regency had done
very much to heighten and intensify regret for the calamity
of 1810. The errors of the old monarch came, naturally,
to be dwarfed to the view, when his private virtues acquired
all the sharp saliency of contrast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Since his death, political writers have usually been
somewhat harsh to his memory. But the verdict of history
has not yet been given in. When the time for its delivery
shall at length come, there will be a long roll of good deeds
to set off against many mistakes in policy. Nor will the
genuine piety, and the earnest conscientiousness of the
individual man—up to the measure of the light vouchsafed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>to him—be forgotten in the preliminary summing up.
What <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> did for Britain simply in conferring
upon it the social blessings of a pure Court, and of
a bright personal example, is best to be estimated by contemplating
what, in that respect, existed before it, and also
what came immediately after it. Comparisons of such a
sort will serve, eventually, to better purpose than that of
feathering the witty shafts of reckless satirists, whether in
prose or in verse. Meanwhile, it is enough to say that no
honester, no more God-fearing man, than was <span class='sc'>George the
Third</span>, ever sat upon the throne of England.</p>

<p class='c010'>During all the time of his long illness, the King’s Library
had continued, more or less, to grow. When he died, it
contained sixty-five thousand two hundred and fifty
volumes, besides more than nineteen thousand unbound
tracts.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>State of
the King’s
Library in
January,
1820.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
These have since been bound severally. The total
number of volumes, therefore, which the Collection comprised
was about eighty-four thousand. At the time of the
King’s decease, the annual cost of books in progress, and of
periodical works, somewhat exceeded one thousand pounds.
The annual salaries of the staff—four officers and two
servants—amounted to eleven hundred and seventy-one
pounds. The Library occupied a fine and extensive suite
of rooms in Buckingham Palace. One of them was large
enough to make a noble billiard-room.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Royal Library, therefore, embarrassed King <span class='sc'>George
the Fourth</span> in two ways. It cost two thousand two hundred
pounds a year, even without making any new additions
to its contents. It occupied much space in the royal
residence which could be devoted to more agreeable purposes.
Then came the welcome thought that, instead of
being a charge, it might be made a source of income. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>Emperor of Russia was known to covet, as a truly imperial
luxury, what to the new King of Great Britain was but a
costly burden. He broached the idea—but met, instead of
encouragement, with strong remonstrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>The news of the royal suggestion soon spread abroad.
Amongst those who heard of it with disgust were Lord
<span class='sc'>Farnborough</span> (who is said to have learnt the design in
talking, one day, with Princess <span class='sc'>Lieven</span>) and Richard
<span class='sc'>Heber</span>. Both men bestirred themselves to prevent the
King from publicly disgracing the country in that way.
Lord <span class='sc'>Farnborough</span> betook himself to a conference with
the Premier, Lord <span class='sc'>Liverpool</span>. Mr. <span class='sc'>Heber</span> discussed the
matter with Lord <span class='sc'>Sidmouth</span>. By the ministers, public
opinion upon the suggested sale was pretty strongly and
emphatically conveyed to His Majesty, whatever may have
been the courtliness of tone employed about it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Conference between George IV and his Ministers on disposal of the Library.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>George the Fourth</span>, however, was not less strongly
impressed by the charms of the prospective rubles from
Russia. He felt that he could find pleasant uses for a
windfall of a hundred and eighty thousand pounds, or so.
And he fought hard to secure his expected prize—or some
indubitably solid equivalent.

the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite> (Dec.,
1850), vol.
lxxxviii, p.
143;<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘If I can’t have the rubles,’
said the King, ‘you must find me their value in pounds
sterling.’ The Ministers were much in earnest to save the
Library, and, in the emergency, laid their hands upon a
certain surplus which had accrued from a fund furnished
some years before by France, to meet British claims for
losses sustained at the date of the first French Revolution.

But the expedient became the subject of an unpleasant
hint in the House of Commons. And the Government, it
is said, then resorted to that useful fund, the ‘Droits of
Admiralty.’ By hook or crook, <span class='sc'>George the Fourth</span>
received his ‘equivalent.’ He then sat down to his writing-table
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>(at Brighton), to assure Lord <span class='sc'>Liverpool</span>—in his
official capacity—of the satisfaction he felt in having
‘this means of advancing the Literature of my Country.’
Then he proceeded to add:—‘I also feel that I am paying
a just tribute to the memory of a Parent, whose life was
adorned with every public and private virtue.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The Executors or Trustees of King <span class='sc'>George the Third</span>
knew well what the monarch’s feelings about his Library
would, in all reasonable probability, have been, had he
possessed mental vigour when preparing for his last change.
They exacted from the Trustees of the Museum a pledge
that the Royal Library should be preserved apart, and
entire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The New Building erected for the Georgian Library.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Parliament, on its side, made a liberal provision for the
erection of a building worthy to receive the Georgian
Library. The fine edifice raised in pursuance of a parliamentary
vote cost a hundred and forty thousand pounds.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1821–28.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It provided one of the handsomest rooms in Europe for the
main purpose, and it also made much-needed arrangements
for the reception and exhibition of natural-history Collections,
above the books.</p>

<p class='c011'>The removal of the Royal Library from Buckingham
House was not completed until August, 1828. All who
saw the Collection whilst the building was in its first
purity of colour—and who were old enough to form an
opinion on such a point—pronounced the receptacle to be
eminently worthy of its rich contents. The floor-cases and
the heavy tables—very needful, no doubt—have since
detracted not a little from the architectural effect and elegance
of the room itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Along with the printed books, and the extensive geographical
Collections, came a number of manuscripts—on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>historical, literary, and geographical subjects.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c013'><sup>[17]</sup></a> By some
transient forgetfulness of the pledge given to Lord <span class='sc'>Farnborough</span>,
the manuscripts, or part of them, were, in March,
1841, sent to the ‘Manuscript Department’ of the Museum.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Minutes of
Evidence</cite>
(1850), as
above.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, then the Keeper of the Printed Books,
successfully reclaimed them for their due place of deposit,
according to the arrangement of 1823. Nor was such a
claim a mere official punctilio.</p>

<p class='c011'>In every point of view, close regard to the wishes of
donors, or of those who virtually represent them, is not more
a matter of simple justice than it is a matter of wise and
foreseeing policy in the Trustees of Public Museums. The
integrity of their Collections is often, and naturally, an
anxious desire of those who have formed them. In a subsequent
chapter (C. ii of Book III) it will be seen that the
wish expressed by the representatives of King <span class='sc'>George the
Third</span> was also the wish of a munificent contemporary and
old minister of his, who, many years afterwards, gave to
the Nation a Library only second in splendour to that which
had been gathered by <span class='sc'>George the Third</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not the least curious little fact connected with the
Georgian Library and its gift to the Public, is that the gift
was <em>predicted</em> thirty-one years before <span class='sc'>George the Fourth</span>
wrote his letter addressed to Lord <span class='sc'>Liverpool</span> from the
Pavilion at Brighton, and twenty-eight years before the
death of <span class='sc'>George the Third</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1791, Frederick <span class='sc'>Wendeborn</span> wrote thus:—‘The
King’s private Library&#160;... can boast very valuable and magnificent
books, which, as it is said, will be one time or another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>joined to those of the British Museum.’ <span class='sc'>Wendeborn</span><a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c013'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
was a German preacher, resident in London for many
years. He was known to Queen <span class='sc'>Charlotte</span>, and had
occasional intercourse with the Court. May it not be
inferred that on some occasion or other the King had intimated,
if not an intention, at least a thought on the matter,
which some courtier or other had repeated in the hearing
of Dr. <span class='sc'>Wendeborn</span>?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Book II</span>, Chap. V. <span class='sc'>The Founder of the Banksian Museum and Library.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>We have now to glance at the career—personal and
scientific—of an estimable public benefactor, with whom
King <span class='sc'>George the Third</span> had much pleasant intercourse,
both of a public and a private kind. Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span>
was almost five years younger than his royal friend and
correspondent, but he survived the King by little more
than three months, so that the Georgian and the Banksian
Libraries were very nearly contemporaneous accessions.
The former, as we have seen, was given in 1823, and fully
received in 1828; the latter was bequeathed (conditionally)
in 1820, and received in 1827. These two accessions,
taken conjointly, raised the Museum collection of books
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>(for the first time in its history) to a respectable rank
amongst the National Libraries of the day. The Banksian
bequest made also an important addition to the natural-history
collections, especially to the herbaria. It is as a
cultivator and promoter of the natural sciences, and pre-eminently
of botany, that Sir Joseph won for himself enduring
fame. But he was also conspicuous for those personal
and social qualities which are not less necessary to the man,
than are learning and liberality to the philosopher. For
the lack of such personal qualities some undoubted public
benefactors have been, nevertheless, bad citizens. In this
public benefactor both sets of faculties were harmoniously
combined. They shone in his form and countenance. They
yet dwell in the memory of a survivor or two, here and
there, who were the contemporaries of his closing years.</p>

<p class='c011'>Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span> was born at Reresby Abbey, in Lincolnshire,
on the thirteenth of December, 1743. He was the
only son of William <span class='sc'>Banks-Hodgkenson</span>, of Reresby
<span class='sc'>Abbey</span>, by his wife Sophia <span class='sc'>Bate</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Bankeses of Reresby Abbey.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Banks-Hodgkenson</span> was the descendant of a Yorkshire
family, which was wont, of old, to write itself
‘Banke,’ and was long settled at Banke-Newton, in the
wapentake of Staincliffe. The second son of a certain
Henry <span class='sc'>Banke</span>, of Banke-Newton, acquired, by marriage,
Beck Hall, in Giggleswick; and by his great-grandson, the
first Joseph <span class='sc'>Bankes</span>, Reresby Abbey was purchased
towards the close of the seventeenth century. His son (also
Joseph) sat in Parliament for Peterborough, and served as
Sheriff of Lincolnshire in 1736. The second (and eldest
surviving) son of the Member for Peterborough took the
name of <span class='sc'>Hodgkenson</span>, as heir to his mother’s ancestral
estate of Overton, in Derbyshire, but on the death of his
elder brother (and his consequent heirship) resumed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>paternal name, and resigned the Overton estate to his
next brother, who became Robert <span class='sc'>Hodgkenson</span>, of Overton.
Mr. <span class='sc'>Banks-Hodgkenson</span> died in 1761, leaving to his son,
afterwards Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, a plentiful estate.</p>

<p class='c011'>The youngster was then little more than beginning his
career at Oxford, whither he had recently come from Eton,
though his schooling had been begun at Harrow.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Early
years of
Sir Joseph
Banks.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He was
‘lord of himself,’ and of a fine fortune, at the critical age
of eighteen. To many, such an inheritance, under like
circumstances, has brought misery. To Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, it
brought noble means for the prosecution of a noble aim.
It was the ambition of this young Etonian—not to eclipse
jockies, or to dazzle the eyes of fools, but—to tread in the
footsteps of <span class='sc'>Linnæus</span>. Rich, hardy, and handsome in
person, sanguine in temperament, and full of talent, he
resolved that, for some years to come, after leaving the
University, the life that might so easily be brimmed with
enjoyments should incur many privations and face many
hardships, in order to win both knowledge and the power
of benefiting the Public by its communication. That
object of early ambition, it will be seen, was abundantly
realised in the after-years.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is no reason to think that a resolution, not often
formed at such an age as eighteen, was come to in the
absence of temptation to a different course. <span class='sc'>Banks</span> was
no ascetic. Nor was it his fortune, at any time, to live
much with ascetics. One of his earliest friends was that
Lord <span class='sc'>Sandwich</span><a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c013'><sup>[19]</sup></a> whose memory now chiefly connects itself
with the unsavoury traditions of Medmenham Abbey, and
with the peculiar pursuits in literature of John <span class='sc'>Wilkes</span>.
With <span class='sc'>Sandwich</span> he spent many of the bright days of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>youth in fishing on Whittlesea Mere. <span class='sc'>Banks</span> had the
good fortune—and the skill—to make his early acquaintanceship
with the future First Lord of the Admiralty conducive
to the interests of science. The connexion with
the Navy of another friend of his youth, Henry <span class='sc'>Phipps</span>,
afterwards Earl of <span class='sc'>Mulgrave</span>, was also turned, eventually,
to good account in the same way.</p>

<p class='c011'>Part of young <span class='sc'>Banks’</span> vacations were passed at Reresby
and in frequent companionship with Lord <span class='sc'>Sandwich</span>;
part at his mother’s jointure-house at Chelsea, very near to
the fine botanic garden which, a few years before, had been
so much enriched by the liberality of Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span>.
In that Chelsea garden, and in other gardens at Hammersmith,
<span class='sc'>Banks</span> studied botany with youthful ardour. And
he made frequent botanic excursions in the then secluded
neighbourhood. In the course of one of these rambles he
fell under suspicion of felony.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Banks’ youthful adventure near Hammersmith.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>He was botanizing in a ditch, and his person happened
to be partially concealed by a thick growth of briars and
nettles, at a moment when two or three constables, who
were in chase of a burglar, chanced to approach the spot.
The botanist’s clothes were in a miry condition, and his suspicious
posture excited in the minds of the local Dogberries
the idea that here they had their man. They were deaf
to all expostulations. The future President of the Royal
Society was dragged, by ignominious hands, before the
nearest justice. The magistrate agreed with the constables
that the case looked black, but, before committing either the
prisoner or himself, he directed that the culprit’s pockets
should be searched. They contained little money, and no
watches; but an extraordinary abundance of plants and
wild flowers. The explanations which before had been
refused were now accepted, and very courteous apologies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>were tendered to the victim of an excess of official zeal.
But the awkwardness of the adventure failed to deter the
sufferer from his eager pursuit, in season and out of it, of
his darling science. A botanist he was to be.</p>

<p class='c011'>He left Oxford in 1763, and almost instantly set out on
a scientific voyage to Newfoundland and Labrador.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The first
Voyage of
Exploration
to
Newfoundland
and
Labrador.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Here
he laid the first substantial groundwork of his future collections
in natural history. He sailed with <span class='sc'>Phipps</span>, who
was already a captain in the Navy, and had been charged
with the duty of protecting the Newfoundland fisheries.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1763.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The voyage proved to be one of some hardship, but its
privations rather sharpened than dulled the youthful naturalist’s
appetite for scientific explorations. He had learned
thus early to endure hardness, for a worthy object.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The second Voyage;—to the South Seas.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>His second voyage was to the South Seas, and it was
made in company with the most famous of the large band
of eighteenth century maritime discoverers—James <span class='sc'>Cook</span>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1768.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and also with a favourite pupil of <span class='sc'>Linnæus</span> (the idol of
<span class='sc'>Banks’</span> youthful fancy), Daniel Charles <span class='sc'>Solander</span>, who,
though he was little above thirty years of age, had already
won some distinction in England, and had been made an
Assistant-Librarian in the British Museum.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c013'><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>To make the voyage of <em>The Endeavour</em> as largely conducive
as was possible to the interests of the natural sciences,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Banks</span> incurred considerable personal expense, and
he induced the Admiralty to make large efforts, on its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>part, to promote and secure the various objects of the new
expedition. One of those objects was the observation at
Otaheite of a coming transit of Venus over the Sun;
another was the further progress of geographical discovery
in a quarter of the world to which public interest was at
that time specially and strongly turned. <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, individually,
was also bent on collecting specimens in all departments
of natural history, and on promoting geographical
knowledge by the completest possible collection of drawings,
maps, and charts of all that was met with. He engaged
Dr. <span class='sc'>Solander</span> as his companion, and gave him a salary of
four hundred pounds a year. With them sailed two
draughtsmen and a secretary, besides four servants.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Botanical Explorations at Terra-del-Fuego.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><em>The Endeavour</em> set sail from Plymouth on the twenty-sixth
of August, 1768, and from Rio-de-Janeiro on the eighth of
December.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1769.
January.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On the fourteenth of January, 1769, the
naturalists landed at Terra-del-Fuego, and they gathered
more than a hundred plants theretofore unknown to European
botanists. Proud of their success, they resolved that,
after a brief rest, they would explore the higher regions, in
hope to reap a rich harvest of Alpine plants. <span class='sc'>Solander</span>,
as a Swede and as a traveller in Norway, knew something
of the dangers they would have to face. <span class='sc'>Banks</span> himself
was not without experience. But both were enterprising
and resolute men. They set out on their long march in
the night of the fifteenth of January, in order to gain as
much of daylight as possible for the work of botanizing.
They hoped to return to the ship within ten hours. As
they ascended, <span class='sc'>Solander</span> warned his companions against
the temptation that he knew awaited them of giving way
to sleep when overcome by the toil of walking. ‘Whoever
sits down,’ said he, ‘will be sure to sleep, and whoever
sleeps will wake no more.’ But the fatigue proved to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>excessive. The foreseeing adviser was borne down by it,
and was the first to throw himself upon the snow. <span class='sc'>Banks</span>
was the younger man by six or seven years, and had a
strong constitution. He fought resolutely against temptation,
and, with the help of the draughtsmen, exerted himself
with all his might to keep <span class='sc'>Solander</span> awake. They succeeded
in getting him to walk on for a few miles more.
Then he lay down again, with the words, ‘Sleep I must, for
a few minutes.’ In those few minutes the fierce cold almost
paralysed his limbs. Two servants (a seaman and a negro)
imitated the Swede’s example, and were really paralysed.
With much grief, it was found that the servants must, inevitably,
be left to their fate. The party had wandered so far
that when they set about to return they were—if the return
should be by the way they had come—a long day’s journey
from the ship. And their route had lain through pathless
woods. Their only food was a vulture. A third man
seemed in peril—momentarily—of death by exhaustion.
Happily, a shorter cut was found. Their journey had not
been quite fruitless. But they all felt that they had bought
their botanical specimens at too dear a rate. Two men were
already dead. One of the draughtsmen seems to have
suffered so severely that he never recovered from the effects
of the journey. Mr. <span class='sc'>Buchan</span> died, three months afterwards,
in Otaheite, just four days after they had landed in
the celebrated island, to visit which was among the especial
objects of their mission.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The stay in Otaheite.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The transit of Venus over the Sun’s disc was satisfactorily
observed on the third of June,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1769.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but the observation had been
nearly foiled by the roguery of a native, who had carried off
the quadrant. The thief was found amongst several
hundred of his fellows, and, but for a characteristic combination
in <span class='sc'>Banks</span> of frank good humour and of firm hardihood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>the spoil would not have been recovered. On this,
as upon many other occasions, both his fine personal
qualities and his genial manners marked him as a natural
leader of men. On occasions, however, of a more delicate
kind they brought him into a peculiar peril. Queen
<span class='sc'>Oberea</span> fell in love with him. She was not herself without
attractions. And they were clad in all the graces of unadorned
simplicity. The poetical satirists of his day used
Sir Joseph—after his return—with cruel injustice if he was
really quite so successful, in resisting feminine charms in
Otaheite, as he had formerly been at home.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Voyage to New Holland.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>But however that may have been, his researches, as a
naturalist, at Otaheite were abundantly successful. And to
the island, in return, he was a friend and benefactor.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1769–1770.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
After
a stay of three months the explorers left Otaheite for New
Holland on the 15th of August, 1769. In Australia their
collections were again very numerous and valuable. But
their long stay in explorations exposed them to two great
dangers, each of which was very nearly fatal to Mr. <span class='sc'>Banks</span>
and to most of his companions. They struck upon a rock,
while coasting New South Wales. Their escape was
wonderful. The accident entailed an amount of injury to
the ship which brought them presently within a peril more
imminent still. Whilst making repairs in the noxious
climate of Batavia, a pestilence seized upon nearly all the
Europeans. Seven, including the ship’s surgeon, died
in Batavia. Twenty-three, including the second draughtsman,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Parkinson</span>, died on shipboard afterwards. <span class='sc'>Banks</span>
and <span class='sc'>Solander</span> were so near death that their recovery
seemed, to their companions, almost miraculous.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Return Home.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>After leaving New South Wales and Batavia they had
a prosperous passage
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1771.
June.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
to the Cape—prosperous, save for the
loss of those whom the pestilence had previously stricken—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>made some additions to their scientific stores. <em>The
Endeavour</em> anchored in the Downs on the 12th of June,
1771, after an absence of nearly three years. Beyond the
immediate and obvious scientific results of the voyage, it
was the means, eventually, of conferring an eminent benefaction
on our West Indian Colonies. It gave them the
Bread-Fruit tree (<em>Artocarpus incisa</em>). The transplantation
of <span class='sc'>God’s</span> bounties from clime to clime was a favourite
pursuit—and a life-long one—with Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, and
its agencies cost him much time and thought, as well as no
small expenditure of fortune.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hardships and sufferings of Terra-del-Fuego and of
Batavia had not yet taken off the edge of his appetite for
remote voyages.

July.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
but the foolish and obstructive
conduct of our Navy Board inspired him with a temporary
disgust. He then turned his attention to Northern Europe.
He resolved that after visiting the western isles of Scotland
he would explore Iceland. <span class='sc'>Solander</span> was again his companion,
together with two other northern naturalists, Drs.
<span class='sc'>Lind</span> and <span class='sc'>Von Troil</span>. <span class='sc'>Banks</span> chartered a vessel at his
own cost (amounting, for the ship alone, to about six hundred
pounds).</p>

<p class='c011'>Before starting for the cold north, they refreshed their
eyes with the soft beauties of the Isle of Wight. There,
said one of the delighted party, ‘Nature has spared none
of her favours;’ and a good many of us have unconsciously
repeated his remark, long afterwards. They reached the
Western Isles of Scotland before the end of July, and,
after a long visit, explored Staffa, the wonders of which
were then almost unknown. Scientific attention, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>was first called to them by <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, when he communicated
to Thomas <span class='sc'>Pennant</span>, of Downing, his minute survey, and
his drawings of the basaltic columns.</p>

<p class='c011'>He thought that the mind can scarcely conceive of anything
more splendid, in its kind, than the now famous cave.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Visit to
Staffa.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When he asked the local name of it, his guide gave him an

though the name has nowadays become but too familiar to
our ears. ‘The Cave of <span class='sc'>Fiuhn</span>,’ said the islander. ‘Who
or what is “Fiuhn”?’ rejoined <span class='sc'>Banks</span>. The stone, he says,
of which the pillars are formed, is a coarse kind of basalt,
much resembling the ‘Giants’ Causeway’ in Ireland, ‘though
none of them so neat as the specimens of the latter which
I have seen at the British Museum....
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Banks to
Pennant;

Here, it is dirty
brown; in the Irish, a fine black.’ But he carried away
with him the fullest impression of the amazing grandeur of
the whole scene.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Tour in Iceland.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The tourists reached Iceland on the twenty-eighth of
August. They explored the country, and saw everything
notable which it contained. On the twenty-first of September
they visited the most conspicuous of the <em>geysers</em>, or
hot-springs, and spent thirteen hours in examining them.
On the twenty-fourth, they explored Mount Hecla.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most famous geyser described by <span class='sc'>Von Troil</span> (who
acted usually as penman for the party) was situate near a
farm called Harkaudal, about two days’ journey from Hecla.
You see, he tells us, a large expanse of fields shut in, upon
one side, by lofty snow-covered mountains, far away, with
their heads commonly shrouded in clouds, that occasionally
sink (under the force of a prevalent wind) so as to conceal
the slopes, while displaying the peaks. The peaks, at such
moments, seem to spring out of the clouds themselves. On
another hand, Hecla is seen, with its three ice-capped summits,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>and its volcanic vapours; and then, again, a ridge of
stupendous rocks, at the foot of which the boiling springs
gush forth, with deafening roar, and are backed by a broad
marsh containing forty or fifty other springs, or ‘geysers,’
from which arise immense columns of vapour, subject of
course to all the influences and lightings-up of wind and
sky. Our tourists carefully watched the ‘spoutings’ of the
springs—which are always fitful—and, according to their
joint observations, some of these rose to the height of sixty
feet.

Occasionally—it has since been observed by later
explorers—they reach to an elevation of more than three
times that number of feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor did Mr. <span class='sc'>Banks</span> neglect the literature of Iceland,
which abounds with interest. He bought the Library of
Halfdan <span class='sc'>Einarsson</span>, the literary historian of Iceland, and
made other large and choice collections. And he presented
the whole to the British Museum—after bestowing,
I believe, some personal study on their contents—upon his
return to England at the close of the year.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Social position and influence of Sir Joseph Banks.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>For many generations, it has been very conducive to the
possession of social prestige in this country that a man
should have acquired the reputation of an adventurous traveller.
Even if the traveller shall have seen no anthropophagi,
no men ‘whose heads do grow beneath their
shoulders,’ he is likely to attain to some degree of social
eminence, merely as one who has explored those</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

      <div class='line'>‘Antres vast and desarts idle,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>of which home-keeping people have no knowledge, save
from the tales of voyagers. To prestige of this kind, Mr.
<span class='sc'>Banks</span> added respectable scientific attainments, a large
fortune, and a liberal mind. He was also the favoured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>possessor of graceful manners and of no mean powers of
conversation. It was, therefore, quite in the ordinary course
of things that his house in London should become one of
the social centres of the metropolis. It became much more
than that. From the days of his youth <span class='sc'>Banks</span> had seen
much of foreigners; he had mixed with men of European
distinction. An extensive correspondence with the Continent
became to him both a pursuit and an enjoyment, and
one of its results, in course of time, was that at his house
in Soho Square every eminent foreigner who came to England
was sure to be seen. To another class of persons that
house became scarcely less distinguished as the abode, not
only of the rich Collections in natural history which their
owner had gone so far to seek, and had gathered with so
much toil and hardship, but of a noble Library, for the
increase of which the book-shops of every great town in
Europe had been explored.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Royal Society, and its history under the rule of Sir Joseph Banks.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The possessor of such manifold distinctions and of such
habits of mind seemed, to most men, marked out as the
natural head of a great scientific institution. Such a
man would be sure to reflect honour on the Society, as
well as to derive honour from his headship. But at this
particular epoch the Royal Society (then the one conspicuous
scientific association in the kingdom) was much embroiled.
Mr. <span class='sc'>Banks</span> was, in many respects, just the man
to assuage dissensions. But these particular dissensions
were of a kind which his special devotion to natural
history tended rather to aggravate than to soften.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mathematicians, as all men know, have been illustrious
benefactors to the world, but—be the cause what it may—they
have never been famous for a large-minded estimate
of the pursuits and hobbies of other men, whom Nature
had not made mathematical. At the time when Joseph
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span><span class='sc'>Banks</span> leaped—as one may say—into eminence, both
scientific and social, in London, Sir John <span class='sc'>Pringle</span> was
President of the Royal Society, and his position there somewhat
resembled the position in which we have seen Sir
Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> to have been placed.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See before,
Book I,
c. 6.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Like Sir Hans,
<span class='sc'>Pringle</span> was an eminent physician, and a keen student of
physics. He did not give umbrage to his scientific team,
exactly in the way in which <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> had given it—by an
overweening love of reading long medical papers. But
natural, not mathematical, philosophy, was his forte; and
the mathematicians were somewhat uneasy in the traces
whilst Sir John held the reins. If <span class='sc'>Pringle</span> should be
succeeded by <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, there would be a change indeed on
the box, but the style of coachmanship was likely to be
little altered. It is not surprising that there should
have been a good deal of jibbing, just as the change
was at hand, and also for some time after it had been
made.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The election to the Presidency.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Banks</span> was elected to the chair of the Royal Society
on the 30th of November, 1777. He found it to be a
very difficult post.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1777.
30 Nov.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But, in the end, the true geniality of
the man, the integrity of his nature, and the suavity of his
manners, won over most, if not quite all, of his opponents.
The least that can be said of his rule in that chair is that
he made the Royal Society more famous throughout Europe,
than it had ever been since the day when it was presided
over by <span class='sc'>Newton</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>For it was not the least eminent quality of <span class='sc'>Banks’</span> character
that, to him, a touch of <em>science</em> ‘made the whole
world kin.’ He was a good subject, as well as a good man.
He knew the blessings of an aristocratic and time-honoured
monarchy. He had that true insight which enables a man
to discriminate sharply between the populace and the People.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>But, when the interests of science came into play, he could
say—with literal and exactest truth,—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tros Tyriusve mihi nullo discrimine agetur.</span>’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>He took a keen and genial delight both in watching and
in promoting the progress of science on the other side of
the Channel, whether France itself lay under the loose rule
of the republican and dissolute Directory, or under the
curbing hand of the First Consul, who was already rapidly
aspiring towards empire.</p>

<p class='c011'>On ten several occasions, <span class='sc'>Banks</span> was the means of inducing
our Government to restore scientific collections,
which had been captured by British cruisers, to that magnificent
Botanic Garden (the <em>Jardin des Plantes</em>, at Paris)
for which they had been originally destined.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cuvier,
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Éloge de M.
Banks</span></cite>,
passim.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Such conduct
could not but win for him the affectionate reverence of
Frenchmen. On one eminent occasion his good services
went much further.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Banks’ intervention with respect to some of the fruits of the Expedition of la Pérouse.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Men yet remember the European interest excited by the
adventurous expedition and the sad fate of the gallant
seaman, John Francis <span class='sc'>De La Pérouse</span>. When the long
search for <span class='sc'>La Pérouse</span>, which had been headed by the
French Admiral <span class='sc'>Bruni d’Eutrecasteaux</span>, came by discords
to an untimely end, the collection of specimens of natural
history which had been made, in the course of it, by
<span class='sc'>De La Billardière</span>, was brought into an English port.
The commander, it seems, felt much as <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> captain<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c013'><sup>[21]</sup></a>
had felt at the time of our own Revolution of 1688. From
<span class='sc'>Lewis the Sixteenth</span> he had received his commission.
He was unprepared to yield an account of its performance
to anybody else. He brought his cargo to England, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>placed it at the absolute disposal of the French emigrant
Princes.</p>

<p class='c011'>By the eldest Prince, afterwards <span class='sc'>Lewis the Eighteenth</span>,
directions were given that an offer should be made to
Queen <span class='sc'>Charlotte</span> to place at Her Majesty’s disposal
whatever she might be pleased to select from the Collections
of <span class='sc'>La Billardière</span>, and that all the remainder of them
should be given to the British Museum.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the interests of that Museum no man of sense will
think that Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span> was, at any time, indifferent.
At this particular time, he had been, repeatedly, an eminent
benefactor to it. By the French Prince the Collections
were put at his orders for the advantage of the Museum,
of which he was now a Trustee, as well as a benefactor.
But his first thought was for the national honour of
Britain, not for the mere aggrandizement of its Museum.
‘I have never heard,’ said <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, ‘of any declaration of
war between the philosophers of England and the philosophers
of France. These French Collections must go to the
French Museum, not to the British.’ And to France he
sent them, without a moment’s hesitation. Such an act,
I take it, is worthy of the name of ‘cosmopolitanism.’
The bastard imitation, sometimes current under that much
abused term—that which knows of no love of country,
except upon a clear balance of mercantile profit—might be
more fitly called by a plainer word.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Instances of Banks’ liberality to Humboldt.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Nor were Frenchmen the only persons to benefit by the
largeness of view which belonged to the new President of
the Royal Society. At a later period, he heard that Collections
which had been made by William <span class='sc'>Von Humboldt</span>,
and subsequently seized by pirates, had been carried to the
Cape, and there detained. <span class='sc'>Banks</span> sent to the Cape a
commission for their release, and restoration to the Collector.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>He defrayed the expenses, and refused to accept of any
reimbursement. Such actions might well reflect honour
on the Royal Society, as well as on the man whom the
wisest among its fellows had placed at their head.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Royal Society had but a share of its President’s
attention, though the share was naturally a Benjamin’s
portion. He worked assiduously on the Board of Agriculture.
He helped to found the Horticultural Society and
the Royal Institution of London. He became, also, in
1788, a co-founder of that ‘African Institution’ which
contributed so largely, in the earlier years of this century,
to promote geographical discovery in Africa, and to spread—of
dire necessity, at but a snail’s pace—some of the
blessings of Christian civilization to those dark places of
the earth which are full of cruelty.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Banks’</span> close intercourse with the Continent enabled him
to do yeoman’s service to the African Institution. Many
ardent and aspiring young men in all parts of Europe were
fired, from time to time, with an ambition to do some stroke
or other of good work in an enterprise which was, at once,
scientific and, in its ultimate issues, evangelical. Some of
the aspirants were, of course, but very partially fitted or
equipped for such labours. But among those who entered
on it with fairest promise the protégés of <span class='sc'>Banks</span> were
conspicuous. Some brief notice of the services he was
enabled to render in this direction belongs, however, more
fitly, to a somewhat later date than that at which we have,
as yet, arrived.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Banks’ favourable reception at the Court of George III.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Among the Fellows of the Royal Society there had been
much division of opinion as to the eligibility of Joseph
<span class='sc'>Banks</span> for their Presidency. At Court, there was none.
<span class='sc'>George the Third</span>, with all his genuine good nature, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>been unable to restrain a lurking dislike of Sir John
<span class='sc'>Pringle’s</span> friendly intercourse with Benjamin <span class='sc'>Franklin</span>.
He was pleased to see <span class='sc'>Pringle</span> retire to his native Scotland,
and to receive <span class='sc'>Banks</span> at Court, in Sir John’s place. He
did not then anticipate that the new President would, one
day, offend (for a moment) his irrepressible prejudices in a
somewhat like manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes, Sir Joseph’s attendance at Court brought
him into company which had become to him, in some
degree, unwonted. We have seen him making a very
favourable impression in the feminine circles at Otaheite.
But the ladies in attendance on Queen <span class='sc'>Charlotte</span>
were less charmed with him. In March, 1788, I find
Fanny <span class='sc'>Burney</span> diarizing (at Windsor Castle) thus:—‘Sir
Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span> was so exceedingly shy that we made no
acquaintance at all. If, instead of going round the world,
he had only fallen from the moon, he could not appear
less versed in the usual modes of a tea-drinking party.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>D’Arblay,
<cite>Diary</cite>, vol. iv,
p. 128.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But what, you will say, has a tea-party to do with a
botanist, a man of science, and a President of the Royal
Society?’</p>

<p class='c011'>In March, 1779, Mr. <span class='sc'>Banks</span> made a happy marriage
with Dorothea <span class='sc'>Hugessen</span>, daughter and coheir of William
Weston <span class='sc'>Hugessen</span>, of Provender, in Kent. Two years
afterwards, the King made him a Knight Grand Cross of
the Order of the Bath, and cultivated his familiar and frequent
acquaintance both in town and at Windsor. Ere
long, he was still further honoured with the rank of a Privy
Councillor. Both men were deeply interested in agriculture
and in the improvement of stock. Sir Joseph
shared his sovereign’s liking for the Merino breeds; took
an active part in managing those in Windsor Park, and for
many years presided, very successfully, over the annual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>sales. The King had been willing to give away his surplus
stock, for the mere sake of promoting improvement, but he
was made to see that more good was likely to accrue from
sales than from gifts. When in Lincolnshire Sir Joseph
<span class='sc'>Banks</span> laboured hard for the more complete drainage of
the fens, and in many ways furthered the introduction of
sound agricultural methods. He was a good neighbour;
though not a very keen sportsman. And most of his time
was now necessarily passed either in London or in its
neighbourhood. But, among other acts of good fellowship,
he rarely visited Reresby Abbey without patronising a
picnic ball at Horncastle, for the benefit of the public
dispensary of that town. And it was noted by Lincolnshire
people that when, in the after-years, Sir
Joseph’s severe sufferings from gout kept him much
away from Reresby, the dispensary suffered also—from
depletion—until Mr. <span class='sc'>Dymoke</span>, of Scrivelsby, had revived,
after <span class='sc'>Banks’</span> example, the good old annual custom of the
town.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The African Institution.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>It was in the year 1797, and again in 1806, that Sir
Joseph was enabled to render special service to that African
enterprise which lay near his heart, by enlisting in its toils
a zealous German and a not less zealous Swiss—Frederick
<span class='sc'>Hornemann</span> and John Lewis <span class='sc'>Burckhardt</span>. It was the fate
of both of those enterprising men to pay the usual penalty
of African exploration. <span class='sc'>Hornemann</span> succumbed, after six
years’ service. <span class='sc'>Burckhardt</span> was spared to work for ten
years. Some among the minor scientific results of his
well-known travels are preserved in the Public Library at
Cambridge (to which he bequeathed his manuscripts).
Others of them are in the British Museum. The latter
would deserve record in these pages, were it now practicable.
<span class='sc'>Burckhardt</span> died at Cairo on the seventeenth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>October, 1817, just eleven years after his arrival in London,
from Göttingen, with that letter to Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span> in
his pocket which, under Divine Providence, determined his
work in life. Another great public service of a like kind,
rendered by Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span> to his country and to mankind,
was his zealous encouragement of explorations in
Australia.</p>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile, a new outburst of discord in the Royal Society
arose out of a well-merited honour conferred on its President
by the Institute of France, in 1802. It was inevitable
that a body so eminent and illustrious as the French Institute
should not only feel gratitude to Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span>
for that liberality of spirit which had dictated, in the midst
of war, his many gracious and generous acts of service to
Frenchmen, but should long since have reached the conviction
that they would be honouring themselves, not less
than honouring him, by his reception in their midst.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>His election

France.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
During
the momentary lull afforded by the Peace of Amiens—when
the Institute was reorganized by the hand of the great
man who was proud of its badge of fellowship, even when
clad in the dalmatica—they placed <span class='sc'>Banks</span> at the head of
their eight Foreign Members. <span class='sc'>Banks’</span> estimate of the
honour of membership was much like <span class='sc'>Napoleon’s</span>. ‘I
consider this mark of your esteem,’ said <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, in his
reply, ‘the highest and most enviable literary distinction
which I could possibly attain. To be the first elected as an
Associate of the first Literary Society in the world surpasses
my most ambitious hopes.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Several Fellows of the Royal Society resented these warm
acknowledgments.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Letter of Misogallus</cite>,
1802 (privately
printed).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
They thought them both unpatriotic,
and uncomplimentary to themselves. The mathematical
malcontents, with Bishop <span class='sc'>Horsley</span> at their head, eagerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>profited by so favourable an opportunity of renewing the
expression of their old and still lurking dissatisfaction with
the choice of their President. <span class='sc'>Horsley</span> addressed to Sir
Joseph a letter of indignant and angry remonstrance.
Somewhat discreditably, the Bishop chose a pseudonymous
signature instead of manfully affixing his own. ‘<cite>Misogallus</cite>’<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c013'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
was the mask under which he made an appeal to those
anti-Gallican prejudices which so many of us imbibe almost
with our mother’s milk, and have in after-years to get rid
of. He aimed a poisoned dart at his old antagonist,
when pointing one of his many passionate sentences in a
way which he knew would arrest the special attention of
the King. The shaft hit the mark. But the King was
presently appeased. He knew <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, and he knew the
Bishop of St. Asaph.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Sir Joseph Banks as an Author.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>From time to time Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span> contributed many
interesting articles to the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>, and
to the <cite>Annals of Agriculture</cite>. His able paper on the Blight
in Wheat did service in its day, and was separately published.
But it is not as an author that this illustrious man
will be remembered. He knew how to fructify the thoughts
and to disseminate the wisdom of minds more largely
gifted than his own. Necessarily, space and prominence
in the public eye is—more especially after a man’s death—a
good deal determined by authorship. Hence, in our
<cite>Biographical Dictionaries</cite>, a crowd of small writers occupy
a disproportionate place, and some true and illustrious
public benefactors remain almost unnoticed. Undeniably,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>the fame of one such benefactor as a Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span> ought
to outweigh, and must, intrinsically, outweigh, that of many
scores of minor penmen. His benefactions were world-wide.
And by them he, being dead, yet speaks, and will
long continue to speak, to very good and lofty purpose. He
died in London on the ninth of May, 1820, at the venerable
age of eighty-one years completed.</p>

<p class='c011'>He died without issue, and was succeeded in his chief
Lincolnshire estates by the Honourable James Hamilton
<span class='sc'>Stanhope</span> (afterwards Mr. <span class='sc'>Stanhope Banks</span>), and by Sir

Sir Edward <span class='sc'>Knatchbull</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><cite>Will and Codicils</cite>, Jan. 7 and 21; and March 7, 1820.</div>

<p class='c011'>His Library, Herbarium, Manuscripts, Drawings, Engravings,
and all his other subsisting Collections, he
bequeathed to the Trustees of the British Museum, for
public use for ever, subject to a life-use and a life-interest
in them which, together with an annuity, he specifically
bequeathed to the eminent botanist, Robert <span class='sc'>Brown</span>, who
was, for many years, both his friend and his librarian. He
also gave an annuity of three hundred pounds a year to Mr.
<span class='sc'>Bauer</span>, an eminent botanical draughtsman; and he added,
largely, to the innumerable benefactions he had made in his
lifetime to the Botanical Gardens at Kew. To Mr. <span class='sc'>Brown</span>
he also left the use, for life, of his town house in Soho Square,
subject to the life-interest, or the voluntary concession, of
the testator’s widow.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his first Codicil, Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span> made a proviso
that, if it should be the desire of the Trustees of the British
Museum—and if that desire should also receive the approval
of Mr. <span class='sc'>Brown</span>—the life-possessor should be at full liberty
to cause the Collections to be transferred to the Museum
during his lifetime. That, in fact, was the course which,
by mutual consent, was eventually taken, to the manifest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>advantage of the British Public and the promotion of
Science.</p>

<p class='c010'>Part of Sir Joseph’s personal Manuscripts were bequeathed
to the Royal Society; another portion to the British Museum;
and a third portion (connected with the Coinage of the
Realm) to the Royal Mint. A minor part of his Collections
in Natural History had been given to the British Museum
in his own lifetime,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Other bequests.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and he had personally superintended
their selection and arrangement. He had also been a benefactor
to the Hunterian Museum at Glasgow, to the
Museum of the London College of Surgeons, and to that,
also in London, formerly known as ‘Bullock’s Museum.’
He was, throughout life, as eager to give, as he was diligent
to get.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The transfer of the Banksian Collections to the Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>About the year 1825, negotiations were opened by the
Trustees of the British Museum with Mr. Robert <span class='sc'>Brown</span>,
with the view of obtaining for the Public the immediate use
of the Banksian Library and the other Collections, and,
along with them, the public services of the eminent botanist
under whose charge they then were. The then President
of the Royal Society, Sir Humphrey <span class='sc'>Davy</span>, acted for the
Public in that negotiation; but some delays intervened, so
that it was not brought to a close until nearly the end of
the year 1827.</p>

<p class='c011'>At that date, the transfer was effected. Mr. <span class='sc'>Brown</span>
became the head of the Botanical Department of the
Museum, and his accession to the Staff added honour to the
institution—in the eyes of all scientific Europe—as well as
eminent advantage to the public service. Mr. <span class='sc'>Brown</span>
acted as Keeper until nearly the time of his decease. He
died in the year 1858, full of years and of botanical
fame.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>The Library of Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span> comprised the finest
collection of books on natural history which had ever been
gathered into one whole in England. It was also pre-eminently
rich in the transactions, generally, of learned
societies in all parts of the world; and there is a masterly
Catalogue of the Collection, by Jonas <span class='sc'>Dryander</span>, which was
printed, at Sir Joseph’s cost, in the years 1798–1800.

That

vaster as it must needs become before that day shall have
arrived.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Banksian Herbaria.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The Banksian Herbaria comprise <span class='sc'>Banks’</span> own botanical

<span class='sc'>Clayton</span>, <span class='sc'>Aublet</span>, <span class='sc'>Miller</span>, <span class='sc'>Jacquier</span>, and

plants gathered during those many English Voyages of
Discovery which, from time to time, <span class='sc'>Banks’</span> example and
his liberal encouragement so largely fostered. From the
Collections now seen in the Botanical Room of the British
Museum not a few of the great works of <span class='sc'>Linnæus</span>, <span class='sc'>Gronovius</span>,
and other famous botanists, derived some of their
best materials. These Collections are at present under the

light which can be applied to their accommodation. Any
attempt, however, now to diminish that difficulty by segregating

<span class='sc'>Planta</span>.—<em>His labours for the enlargement of the

<span class='sc'>Bedford</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hitherto these pages have chiefly had to do with the
history of the integral parts of the British Museum, and
with that of the men by whom these integral parts, taken
severally, were first founded or first gathered. We have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>now to glance at the organic history of the whole, after the
primary Collections and the early additions to them came,
by aggregation, to be combined into the existing national
establishment. It may, at best, be only by glances that so
wide a subject can (within the limits of this one volume)
be looked over, in retrospect. That necessity of being brief
suggests a connection of the successive epochs in the story
of the Museum, for seventy years, with the lives of the
three eminent men who have successively presided over the
institution since the beginning of the present century.
Those three official lives, I think, will be found to afford
succinct divisions or breakings of the subject, as well as to
possess a distinctive personal interest of their own. Our
introductory chapters will therefore—in relation to the
chapters which follow them—be, in part, retrospective, and,
in part, prospective.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Dr. Charles <span class='sc'>Morton</span> died (10 February, 1799),
Joseph <span class='sc'>Planta</span> was, by the three principal Trustees, appointed
to be his successor. The choice soon commended
itself to the Public by the introduction of some important
improvements into the internal economy of the institution.
It is the first librarianship which is distinctively marked as
a reforming one. In more than one of his personal qualities
Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta</span> was well fitted for such a post as that of Principal
Officer of the British Museum. He had been for
many years in the service of the Trustees. He had won
the respect of Englishmen by his literary attainments. He
was qualified, both by his knowledge of foreign languages
and by his eminent courtesy of manners, for that salient
part of the duties of librarianship which consists in the
adequate reception and the genial treatment of strangers.</p>

<p class='c011'>Joseph <span class='sc'>Planta</span> was of Swiss parentage. He was of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>race and family which had given to Switzerland several
worthies who have left a mark in its national history. He
was born, on the twenty-first of February, 1744, at Castasegna,
where his father was the pastor of a reformed church.
The boy left Switzerland before he had completed the
second year of his age.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Life of
Joseph
Planta,
third
Principal-Librarian.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He began his education at Utrecht,
and continued it, first at the University of Göttingen, and
afterwards by foreign travel—whilst yet open to the formative
influences of youthful experience upon character—both
in France and in Italy. It was thus his fortune to combine
what there is of good in the characteristics of the cosmopolite
with what is better in those of a patriotic son of the
soil. It was Joseph <span class='sc'>Planta’s</span> fortune never to live in
Switzerland, as a resident, after the days of early infancy,
but, for all that, he remained a true Swiss. And one of the
acts of his closing years in England was to make a most
creditable contribution to Helvetic history.</p>

<p class='c011'>Andrew <span class='sc'>Planta</span>, father of Joseph, came to London in
1752. He was a man of good parts and of pleasing
address. He established himself as pastor of a German
congregation, and was also made an Assistant-Librarian in
the British Museum. Afterwards, he was chosen to be a
Fellow of the Royal Society and a ‘reader’ to Queen
<span class='sc'>Charlotte</span>. That appointment brought with it, in course
of time, a measure of Court influence by which young
<span class='sc'>Planta</span> profited. His youthful ‘<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wanderjahre</span></i>’ had inspired
the growing man with a keen desire to see more of
foreign countries. When the father’s favour at Court put
him in a position to represent at head-quarters the youth’s
fancy to see life abroad, and to state (as he truthfully could)
that neither talent nor industry were lacking in his
character, the statement obtained for Joseph <span class='sc'>Planta</span> the
secretaryship of legation at Brussels. There, he felt himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>to be in an element which suited him; but his filial affection
brought him back to England in 1773, in order that
he might solace the last days, on earth, of his father. In
that year the elder <span class='sc'>Planta</span> died.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was also in 1773 that Joseph <span class='sc'>Planta</span> became an
Assistant-Librarian. In the next year he was appointed
to succeed Dr. <span class='sc'>Maty</span> in both of his then offices. At the
Royal Society he succeeded him as Secretary; at the
Museum, he succeeded him as an Under-Librarian—when
the Doctor was made head of the establishment. His new
post at the Museum brought to <span class='sc'>Planta</span> the special charge
of the Department of MSS.</p>

<p class='c011'>Joseph <span class='sc'>Planta</span> had already made—immediately after
his first appointment as Assistant-Librarian—his outset in
authorship by the publication of his <cite>Account of the Romansch
Language</cite>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Phil. Trans.</cite>,
vol. lxvi, pp.
129–160.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is a scholarly production, though (it need
hardly be said) not what would be expected, on such
a subject, after the immense stride made in linguistical
studies during the ninety-five years which have elapsed
since it was given to literature, in pages in which nowadays
such a treatise would hardly be looked for. Its first
appearance was in the <cite>Philosophical Transactions</cite>. In 1776
it was translated into German and printed at Chamouni.</p>

<p class='c011'>The subsequent years were devoted, almost exclusively, to
the proper duties of his Museum office—on the days of
service—and to those of the Paymastership of Exchequer
Bills, a function to which Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta</span> was appointed in
1788, and the duties of which he discharged, with efficiency
and honour, for twenty-three years. Authorship had but
little of his time until a much later period of life.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little before his appointment in the administrative
service of the country, <span class='sc'>Planta</span> had married Miss Elizabeth
<span class='sc'>Atwood</span>. For him, marriage did just the opposite of what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>it has, now and then, been said to do for some other men.
It took off the edge of his liking for foreign travel. For
it gave him a very happy home. Their union endured for
twenty-four years. <span class='sc'>Planta</span> was not a man of the gushing
sort.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Falkenstein,
<cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zeitgenossen</span></cite>,
&amp;c., Dritte
Reihe, Bd. ii,
pp. 3, seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But, to intimates, he would say—in the lonely years;
there were to be but few of them—‘She was an angel
in spirit and in heart.’ Mrs. <span class='sc'>Planta</span> died in 1821.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the death of Charles <span class='sc'>Morton</span>, Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta</span>, as we
have seen already, was made Principal-Librarian. He
found the Museum still in its infancy, although no less
than forty-six years had passed since the bequest of Sir
Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> was made to the British Public, and more
than forty years since that Public had entered upon its inheritance.
The collections had kept pace with the growth
of science only in one or two departments. In others
the arrear was enormous. The accessibility was hampered
with restrictions. The building was in pressing need of
enlargement, gradual as had been the growth of some
sections, and glaring as was the deficiency of other
sections.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Planta</span> put his shoulders to the wheel, and met with
support and encouragement from several of the Trustees.
But the feeling still ran strongly against any approach
to indiscriminate publicity in any department of the
Museum. Men did not carry that restrictive view quite so
far in 1800, as it had been expressed by Dr. John <span class='sc'>Ward</span>—an
able and good man—in 1760, and earlier; but they
still looked with apprehension upon the combined ideas of
a crowd of visitors, and irreplaceable treasures of learning
and of art. A good many of the men of 1800 possessed,
it must in candour be remembered, living recollections of
the sights and the deeds of 1780. Residents in Bloomsbury
were likely, on that score, to have particularly good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>memories. They had seen with their eyes precious manuscripts,
which treasured up the life-long lore of a <span class='sc'>Mansfield</span>,
given by the populace to the flames.</p>

<p class='c011'>Under the influence of such memories as these, Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta</span>
had to propose abolition of restrictions, with a gentle and
very gradual hand. He began by improving the practice,
without at first greatly altering the rules. By and by he
brought, from time to time, before the Trust, suggestions
for relaxations in the rules themselves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Improvements introduced, or recommended, by Joseph Planta, in the internal economy of the Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>From the outset he administered the Reading-Room
itself with much liberality. When he became Principal-Librarian the yearly admissions were much under two
hundred. In 1816, they had increased to two hundred
and ninety-two. In 1820, to five hundred and fifteen. As
respects the Department of Antiquities, the students admitted
to draw were in 1809 less than twenty; in 1818
two hundred and twenty-three were admitted. In 1814
he recommended the Trustees to make provision for the
exhibition every Thursday, ‘to persons applying to see
them,’ the Engravings and Prints;—the persons admitted
not exceeding six at any one time, and others being
admitted in due succession. He also recommended a somewhat
similar system of exhibition for adoption in the
Department of Coins and Medals. And the Trustees gave
effect to both recommendations. Eventually Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta</span>
proposed, for the <em>general</em> show Collections of the Museum,
a system of entirely free admission at the instant of application,
abolishing all the hamper of preliminary forms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>His recommendations for the enlargement of the various Collections.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>It was also, I believe, at Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta’s</span> instance, or
partly so, that the Trustees applied to Parliament, in 1812,
for special grants to enable them to improve the Collection
of Printed Books, with reference more particularly to the
endeavour to perfect the National Library in the National
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>History—to that very limited extent to which the monuments
and memorials of our history are to be found in
print. Virtually, the grants on behalf of the Manuscript
Department, not those on behalf of the Printed Book
Department, were, in 1812, as they still are in 1870, the
grants which mainly tend to make the British Museum
what, most obviously, it ought to become, the main storehouse
of British History and Archæology, both in literature
and in art.</p>

<p class='c011'>The magnificent additions made by private donors to
every section of the British Museum during the administration
of <span class='sc'>Planta</span>, have been sufficiently passed under
review in the closing chapters of Book II. Several of them,
it has been seen, were the fruits of the public spirit of individual
Trustees. Such gifts amply vindicated the wisdom
both of Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane</span> and of Parliament, when both
Founder and Legislature gave to men of exalted position a
preference as peculiarly fit, in the judgment of each, for the
general guardianship of the Museum.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>His catholicity of tastes and sympathies.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>But private gifts—munificent as they were—left large
gaps in the National Collections. It is one of Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta’s</span>
distinctive merits that his tastes and sympathies embraced
the Natural History Department, as well as those literary
departments with which, as a man of letters, he had a more
direct personal connection. He supported, with his influence,
the wise recommendation to Parliament—made in
1810—for the purchase of the <span class='sc'>Greville</span> Collection of
Minerals. He recommended, in 1822, the purchase, from
the representatives of the naturalist <span class='sc'>Monticelli</span>, of a like,
though minor Collection, which had been formed at Naples.
The Cavaliero <span class='sc'>Monticelli’s</span> Collection was, in the main, one
that had been undertaken in imitation of an earlier assemblage
of volcanic products which had been also gathered at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>Naples by Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span>, and by the Collector
given (as I have already recorded) to the Trustees. In
a similar spirit he promoted the acquisitions which
were made from time to time, by the instrumentality
of Claudius <span class='sc'>Rich</span>, of Henry <span class='sc'>Salt</span>, and of several other
workers in the fruitful field of Classical, Assyrian, and
Egyptian archæological exploration. Both in the literary
and scientific departments of the Museum he also gave some
special attention to the due continuance and completion of
the various collections bestowed on the Public by the
munificence of Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another conspicuous merit belongs to Joseph <span class='sc'>Planta</span>.
He supported the Trustees in that wise and large-minded
policy which induced them to regard <em>publication</em>, as well as
accumulation, to be one of the chief duties of their Trust for
the Nation. He thought it not enough, for example, to show
to groups of Londoners, from time to time, and to occasional
foreign visitants, in almost solitary state, the wealth of
Nature and of Art in the Museum Collections. He saw it
to be no less the duty of the faithful trustees of such treasures
to show them to the world at large by the combined
labours of the painter, the draughtsman, the engraver, and
the printer.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Planta’s Labours on the Museum’s Publications;</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It will ever be an honourable distinction—in the
briefest record of his Museum labours—that he promoted
the publication of the beautiful volumes entitled <cite>Description
of the Ancient Marbles in the British Museum</cite>; of the
<cite>Catalogue of the Anglo-Gallic Coins</cite>; of the <cite>Mausoleum
and Cinerary Urns</cite>; of the <cite>Description of Terra Cottas</cite>;
and other like works. The first-named work in particular
is an especial honour to the Trustees of the Museum, and
to all who were concerned in its production. Beautifully
engraved, and ably edited, it made the archæological treasures
of the Nation widely known even to such foreigners,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>interested in the study of antiquity, as circumstances precluded
from ever seeing the marbles themselves. When
watching—in the bygone years—the late Henry <span class='sc'>Corbould</span>
busy at the work into which he threw so much of his love,
as well as of his skill in drawing, I have been tempted, now
and then, to envy the craft which, in its results, made our
national possessions familiarly known, in the far parts of
the world, to students who could never hope to see the
wonderful handicraft of the old Greek sculptors, otherwise
than as it is reflected and transmitted by the handicraft of
the skilled modern draughtsman. <span class='sc'>Corbould</span> had the eye
to see artistic beauty and the soul to enjoy it. He was
not one of the artists who are artisans, in everything but
the name. In the ‘<cite>Ancient Marbles in the British Museum</cite>,’
published under the active encouragement of the Trustees
and of their Principal-Librarians, during a long series of
years, <span class='sc'>Corbould</span>, as draughtsman, had just the work for
which Nature had pre-eminently fitted him.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>and, particularly, on the Catalogues.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Joseph <span class='sc'>Planta</span> also took his share in the compilation of
the Catalogues both of Printed Books and of Manuscripts.
In this department, as in the archæological one, he extended
the benefits of his zealous labour to the scholar abroad as
well as to the scholar at home. What was carefully prepared
was liberally <em>printed</em> and liberally circulated. <span class='sc'>Planta</span>
wrote with his own hand part of the published <cite>Catalogue
of the Printed Books</cite>, and much of the <cite>Catalogue of the
Cottonian Manuscripts</cite>. To the latter he prefixed a brief
life of the Founder, by which I have gladly and thankfully
profited in my own more extended labour at the beginning
of this volume.</p>

<p class='c011'>One incidental employment which Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta’s</span> office
entailed upon him—as Principal-Librarian—was of a less
grateful kind. It merits notice on more than one account,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>very trivial as is the incident of Museum history that occasioned
it, when looked at intrinsically.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1821, the then Duke of <span class='sc'>Bedford</span> (John, ninth Duke)
filed in Chancery an injunction against the Trustees to
restrain them from building on the garden-ground of the
Museum.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The
Gardens of
the British
Museum
and the
Duke of
Bedford.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To build was—at that time—an undoubted injury
to the Bloomsburians, and, consequently, a not less undoubted
depreciation of the Duke’s estate. It is hard, nowadays,
to realise to one’s fancy what the former Museum gardens
were in the olden time. They not only adorned every
house that looked over them, but were—in practice, and
by the indulgence of the Trustees and officers—a sort of
small public park for the refreshment of the vicinity at
large. Their neighbourhood made houses more valuable in
the market.</p>

<p class='c011'>Almost seventy years before the filing of the Chancery
injunctions of 1820–21, a predecessor of the Duke (John,
seventh Duke) had compelled Parliament—and with great
reason—to enact that the ‘New Road’ should be made a
broad road; not a narrow lane. He had carried a proviso for
the construction of gardens in front of all the houses along the
road. Were public property, and public enjoyments, protected
by English law with one tenth part of the efficiency with which
private property and private enjoyments are protected, that
clause in the ‘New Road Act’ of 1750 would have proved,
in our own present day, a measure advantageous to public
health. But public easements are unknown, or nearly
unknown, to English law. And the Duke’s clause has
come, in course of time, to teem with public nuisance,
instead of public benefit. Englishmen build at the national
cost magnificent cathedrals, and then permit railway-jobbers
to defile them, at pleasure, with railway ‘architecture.’
They construct, by dint of large taxation, magnificent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>river-embankments, and permit every sort of smoke-belching
chimney and eye-killing corrugated-iron-monstrosity to
spoil the view. What the old Duke of <span class='sc'>Bedford</span> intended
to make a metropolitan improvement, as well as a defence
to his own property, has come to be a cause of public detriment,—simply
because our legislation, in the year of Grace
1870, affords protection to no kind of public property that
is insusceptible, by its nature, of direct valuation in pounds
and pence.</p>

<p class='c011'>The action of the ninth Duke of <span class='sc'>Bedford</span> was in contrast
with that of his predecessor. It was not altogether
selfish, since there was an actual abatement of public enjoyment
in that step which he was opposing. The Trustees of
the British Museum were really compelled to take something
from the Public with one hand;—but, with the other, they
gave a tenfold equivalent. Their contention, of course,
prevailed against the Duke’s opposition.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may not be intrusive here to mention that it is known
that by the present Duke of <span class='sc'>Bedford</span> very generous and
liberal furtherance would be given to new schemes of extension
for the Museum, were Parliament, on full consideration,
to think enlargement at Bloomsbury the right course
to be taken in pending matters. But this subject will
demand a few words hereafter.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Planta’s</span> energies seem for several years to have been
given, almost exclusively, to his Museum duties, in combination
(as was perfectly practicable and befitting, under
the then circumstances) with his Exchequer Paymastership.
But in the closing years of his Under-Librarianship many
months were (not less fitly) given to a worthy literary undertaking.
He wrote his <cite>History of the Helvetic Confederacy</cite>
towards the end of the last century, and published
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>it soon after his appointment to the Principal-Librarianship.
In the next year he published a supplement to it, under
the title of <cite>A View of the Restoration of the Helvetic
Confederacy</cite>. The <cite>History</cite> reached its second edition in
1807.</p>

<p class='c011'>Based primarily on the great work of Johannes <span class='sc'>Von
Müller</span>, <span class='sc'>Planta’s</span> <cite>History of the Helvetic Confederacy</cite>
is both a very able production and one that is animated by
a spirit of patriotism which is wise as well as strong. It
was an enduring contribution to the literature of the
author’s fatherland. After its appearance, his official duties
mainly engrossed his attention. He died, full of years and
honours, in the year 1827, leaving a son, who, like his
father and his grandfather, distinguished himself in the
civil service of their adopted country.</p>

<p class='c011'>Joseph <span class='sc'>Planta</span>, in his fifty-three years of service, had
seen the British Museum pass from its infancy into the
early stages of its maturity. But it still, at the time of
his death, was too much regarded, both by the general
Public and by Parliament, as, in the main, a place of popular
amusement. His next successor saw the beginning of
further improvements, such as lifted the Museum upon a
level with the best of its fellow-institutions in all Europe.
His second successor saw it lifted far above them, in several
points of view. And what he witnessed of augmented
improvement—when leaving office three or four years ago—was,
in a very large measure, the result of his own
zealous labours and of his eminent ability.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> was appointed to be the successor
of Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta</span> (20th December, 1827), the British Museum
was still composed of but four departments, in conformity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>with the organization of 1809. It was publicly open on
three days in each week, but only during forty weeks of
every year. This was a great improvement of the previous
arrangements, as we have seen, under <span class='sc'>Maty</span> and <span class='sc'>Morton</span>.

rule.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta’s</span> most conspicuous improvements lay in
the (admittedly more important) direction of access to the
Medal, Print, and Reading-Rooms. To his administration,
students in all these departments were much indebted. Sir
Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> was to witness and to carry out, very efficiently
as Principal-Librarian, some more extensive modifications
of the old system of things; but he, in his turn,
was to be quite eclipsed (so to speak) in the character of
Museum improver, by his successor in office. And it was,
in fact, to the latter that such among the conspicuous
improvements of the last twenty years of Sir Henry’s
official administration as related to the Department of
Printed Books—and in no department were the improvements
more striking—were pre-eminently due.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> (who has but so recently departed from
amongst us) entered the service of the Trustees, as a temporary
assistant in the Library, in the year 1800, having
had already three years’ experience in Bodley’s Library at
Oxford. When coming occasionally to London during his
employment at Oxford he would see Dr. Charles <span class='sc'>Morton</span>,
who had helped to organize the Museum almost fifty years
before. The <em>public</em> life of those two acquaintances spread,
conjointly, over a period of a hundred and twenty years.<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c013'><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>Had it never fallen to the lot of Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> to render
to the Public any service at all, in the way of administering
and improving the National Museum, he would still have
earned an honourable niche in our literary history. His
contributions to literature are, indeed, very unequal in their
character.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The
labours in
literature
of Sir H.
Ellis.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Some of them are fragmentary; some might be
thought trivial. But very many of them have sterling
value. And his archæological labours, in particular, were
zealous and unremitting. He began them in 1798. He
had not entirely ceased to add to them in 1868. In the
closing year of the eighteenth century he was giving furtherance
to the labours on British history of Richard <span class='sc'>Gough</span>.
In the sixty-eighth year of the nineteenth century he was
still taking an intelligent and critical interest in the large
undertakings of Lord <span class='sc'>Romilly</span> and of Mr. <span class='sc'>Duffus Hardy</span>,
for affording to future historians the means of basing the
reconstruction of our national history upon the one firm
foundation of an exhaustive search of our national records.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fourth Principal-Librarian of the British Museum
was born at Shoreditch, in London, on the 29th of
November, 1777. He was of a Yorkshire family long
settled (and still flourishing) at Dewsbury. Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis</span>
was educated at Merchant Taylors’ School, and at St.
John’s College, Oxford, where he graduated B.C.L. in
1802. His first book (but not, perhaps, his first publication)
was the <cite>History of the Parish of St. Leonard, Shoreditch</cite>,
printed in 1798. He became F.S.A. in 1800; one
of its Secretaries in 1813; and its Director in 1854. To
the <cite>Archæologia</cite> he was a contributor for more than fifty
years. In 1800, he sent to the first Record Commission a
Report on the Historical Manuscripts at St. John’s. For
the same Commission he wrote, in the year 1813, and the
three following years, an <cite>Introduction to Domesday Book</cite>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>Of this he would speak very modestly in after-days,
saying: ‘I have worked on <cite>Domesday</cite> for years; but only
in making an opening into the mine. Other men will
have yet to bring out the metal.’ For the second Record
Commission he re-edited his <cite>Introduction</cite> and considerably
improved it. This was done in 1832; and, to say the least,
it brought some very good ore to the surface. When both
these Commissions had given way to the better organization
recently framed by Lord <span class='sc'>Romilly</span>, he edited, for the
series of <cite>Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain</cite>, the
Latin Chronicle of John of Oxenedes, from a MS. belonging
to Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Cotton’s</span> Library. When <cite>Oxenedes</cite> was
published, just sixty years had passed from the publication
of Sir Henry’s first Record labour, undertaken at the
instance of Lord <span class='sc'>Colchester</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the interval, he had had a great opportunity, the first
glimpse of which needs must have dilated the heart of so
genuine a lover of antiquity. The publication of an improved
edition of the <cite>Monasticon Anglicanum</cite> of <span class='sc'>Dodsworth</span>
and <span class='sc'>Dugdale</span> ought to have made a new epoch in British
archæology. But the opportunity was lost. In those days,
there was no encouragement for such labours at the Treasury;
no enlightened promoter of them at the Rolls House. The
control of the new <cite>Monasticon</cite> passed into the hands of
mere tradesmen. Neither of Mr. <span class='sc'>Ellis’s</span> co-editors ever
buckled to the work. <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> himself became simply the
servant of the associated publishers, who had no aim whatever
beyond turning a golden penny out of the traditional
prestige of Sir William <span class='sc'>Dugdale’s</span> name, and out of the
standing advertisement that the <cite>Monasticon</cite> was indubitably
one of those books ‘which no gentleman’s library ought to
be without.’ Heaps of crude, untranslated, and unelucidated
information were thrust into the book, against the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>editor’s own clear conviction of his duty, and in spite of his
remonstrance. ‘We must retrench,’ was the one answer
to all editorial recommendations of real improvement. And
meanwhile the publishers were actually netting fair profits
from a long list of confiding subscribers. What might
well have been a ‘broadstone of honour’ to English
literature became its glaring disgrace.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c013'><sup>[24]</sup></a> No one would
more gladly have striven for a better result—had the
power lain with him—than would Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis</span>. As
to his nominal co-editors, they did almost nothing, from
first to last.</p>

<p class='c011'>To far better result did <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> labour upon his successive
editions of <cite>Hall</cite>, <cite>Hardyng</cite>, <cite>Fabyan</cite>, and <cite>Polydore Vergil</cite>,
among our chroniclers, and of <span class='sc'>Brand’s</span> <cite>Observations on
Popular Antiquities</cite>, of <span class='sc'>Dugdale’s</span> <cite>History of Saint Paul’s
Cathedral</cite>, and of <span class='sc'>Norden’s</span> <cite>Essex</cite>, among the standard
illustrations of our archæology and topography. But his
most enduring contribution to historical literature is,
beyond doubt, his <cite>Original Letters, illustrative of English
History</cite>, the publication of which began in 1824, and was
completed in 1846. That work alone would suffice to
keep his name in honourable memory for a long time to
come.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>At the British Museum he had a considerable advantage
over his predecessor in the Principal-Librarianship. He
enjoyed the assistance, almost from the first, of an abler
staff, in more than one of the departments, than Mr.
<span class='sc'>Planta</span> had commanded during the earlier years of his
administration.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Labours of
Sir H. Ellis

British
Museum.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And an improved order of service had
been established before Mr. <span class='sc'>Ellis’s</span> rule began. In this
way appliances lay already under his hand which facilitated
the work of progress, when—more especially—a strong demand
for improvement came from without, as well as from
the action of the Trustees themselves within.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>State of the British Museum Staff at the time of the Death of Mr. Planta.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>At that date the Department of Printed Books was under
the charge of the Rev. Henry Hervey <span class='sc'>Baber</span> (the eminent
editor of the ‘Alexandrian MS.’ of the Septuagint). He
was assisted by Mr. Henry Francis <span class='sc'>Cary</span>, the translator of
<span class='sc'>Dante</span>, and also by Mr. <span class='sc'>Walter</span>, who had been one of the
Librarians of King <span class='sc'>George the Third</span>, and who, in 1831,
was succeeded by Mr. Antonio <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>. In the Department
of MSS. Mr. <span class='sc'>Ellis’s</span> Assistant-Keeper, the Rev.
Josiah <span class='sc'>Forshall</span>, had succeeded to the charge, and the
new Keeper had the able assistance of Sir Frederick
<span class='sc'>Madden</span>, whose labours for the improvement of his department
are well known to scholars. The Antiquities were
confided to Mr. Edward <span class='sc'>Hawkins</span>; the various Natural
History Collections to Messrs. <span class='sc'>König</span> and <span class='sc'>Children</span>. The
Botanical Department was, as I have shown at the close
of the preceding Book, just about to be reorganized
(almost to be created) by the transfer of the Collections of
Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, and with them of the services of their
distinguished Keeper. Taken altogether, such a staff as this
was of threefold efficiency to that with which Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta</span>
had started at the beginning of the century.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> enjoyed an additional advantage from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>great familiarity with the whole service of the Museum
which he had acquired during his labours as Secretary
from the year 1814. The secretarial duty had been combined
with the functions of keepership during thirteen
years. Great punctuality, a conspicuous faculty for method
and memory, and very courteous manners, were qualifications
which are not always, or necessarily, found in union
with conspicuous industry. In him they were combined.
Nevertheless, he narrowly escaped losing the merited reward
of long and assiduous labours. For he had a formidable
competitor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Candidature of Mr. H. Fynes Clinton.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>At this time, a most accomplished scholar, who deservedly
possessed large influence, both social and political, had
obtained the virtual promise of almost the highest personage
in the realm that whenever Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta</span> died he
should receive the offer of successorship. Mr. Henry
<span class='sc'>Fynes Clinton</span>, in those quiet ante-reform days, had been
able, for twenty years, to unite the functions of a Member
of Parliament with the assiduous pursuits of scholarship
in one of its highest forms. Learning had higher charms
for him than Politics, and he had no turn for debate, but
he had steadily attended the House of Commons while
giving to the world his <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti Hellenici</span></cite> and <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fasti Romani</span></cite>.
Six months before Mr. <span class='sc'>Planta’s</span> decease, the Archbishop
of <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span> had, in effect, promised Mr. <span class='sc'>Fynes Clinton</span>
that he would nominate him to be Principal-Librarian,
and the Archbishop well knew that, as far as learning went,
such an appointment would be applauded throughout
Europe. The Archbishop (Dr. Charles <span class='sc'>Manners Sutton</span>),
did not forget his promise, and his vote carried that of the
then Speaker of the House of Commons, who was the
Archbishop’s son. Their joint communication with the
Lord Chancellor procured his assent also. ‘We have made,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>the Archbishop told Mr. <span class='sc'>Fynes Clinton</span>, ‘your recommendation
to the King as strong as possible.’ The practice,
as the reader will perhaps remember, was that the then
Principal Trustees should in all such cases recommend to
the Sovereign <em>two</em> names, with such observations upon them
as to those Trustees might seem appropriate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><cite>Letters and Journ. of</cite> H. Fynes Clinton, in the <em>Literary Remains</em> (1854), pass.</div>

<p class='c011'>As Mr. <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> was now the senior officer; had had the
care successively of two several departments (MSS. and
Printed Books); had also served as Secretary, and, in all
these employments, had acquitted himself with diligence
and credit, there could, of course, be no difficulty as to the
name which should be submitted to <span class='sc'>George the Fourth</span>
in company with that of Mr. <span class='sc'>Fynes Clinton</span>. Other
Trustees interested themselves in supporting, indirectly but
efficiently, the claims of one who had served the Board so
long. And the King was pleased to prefer the second
name which had been placed before him by the Principal
Trustees rather than the first.

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Services and character of Sir H. Ellis.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Those who had (like the writer) opportunity to watch,
during most of the succeeding thirty years, the continuance
of that service, know that the King’s selection was justified.
Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> was not gifted with any of those salient
abilities which dazzle the eyes of men; but he had great
power of labour, the strictest integrity of purpose, and a
very kind heart. He was ever, to the Trustees, a faithful
servant, up to the full measure of his ability. To those
who worked under him he was always courteous, considerate,
and very often he was generous. He would sometimes
expose himself to misconstruction, in order to appease
discords. He would at times rather seem wanting in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>firmness of will than, by pressing his authority, wound the
feelings of well-intentioned but irritable subordinates. No
one could receive from him a merited reproof—I speak
from personal experience—without perceiving that the duty
of giving it was felt to be a painful duty. The Commissioners
of 1850 had ample warrant for hinting, in their
Report to the Crown—when alluding to certain internal
disputes—that the qualities least abounding in Sir Henry
<span class='sc'>Ellis’s</span> composition were those which equip a man
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Report</cite> (1850)
p. 32.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘for
such harsher duties of his office, as cannot be accomplished
by the aid of conciliatory manners, the index of a benevolent
disposition.’</p>

<p class='c011'>A man of that temper will now and then, in his own
despite, get forced into a somewhat bitter controversy.
One sharp attack on Sir Henry’s administration of his
Principal-Librarianship had a close connection with discords
of an anterior date which had broken out in the Society of
Antiquaries.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The story
of the MSS.
at Pomard.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The late Sir Harris <span class='sc'>Nicolas</span> would scarcely
have criticised, with so much vehemence, what he thought
to have been a careless indifference on <span class='sc'>Ellis’s</span> part to the
acquisition for the British Museum of an important body
of historical manuscripts, preserved in a chateau in a distant
corner of France (and offered to the Trustees in 1829),
but for the circumstance that Sir Henry’s kindly unwillingness,
evinced a little while before, to desert a very weak
colleague at Somerset House had stood in the way of some
much-needed reforms in that quarter. Without in the
least intending beforehand to represent things unfairly,
Sir H. <span class='sc'>Nicolas</span> acted under the influence of an unconscious
bias or pre-judgment. The Joursanvault story is
still worth telling, although it has now become an old story,
and one portion of the historical treasures it relates to are
now past wishing for, as an English possession.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>In the course of the revolutionary convulsions in France,
a great body of historical documents had been abstracted
from the famous old Castle of Blois. Eventually, as years
passed on, they found their way into the country-seat, at
Pomard, of the Baron de <span class='sc'>Joursanvault</span>, and with them were
amalgamated an extensive collection of old family papers,
many books on genealogy, and some choice illuminated
missals.</p>

<p class='c011'>An English gentleman long resident in France had
formed the acquaintance of the Baron de <span class='sc'>Joursanvault</span>,
and in the course of conversation came to hear of the existence
of these historical treasures. He also perceived that
their owner had little taste for them, or ability to profit by
their contents. Sir Thomas Elmsley <span class='sc'>Croft</span> probed his
French friend on the subject of parting with them. The
Baron lent a willing ear, and, to whet his interlocutor’s
appetite, told him that a great many of the manuscripts
related to the history of the English rule in France. Sir
Thomas then apprised an English friend, famous for his
love of old MSS., of the existence of the hoards, and of the
certainty that the Baron who owned them would greatly
prefer a few rouleaux of English gold to a whole castle-full
of the most precious parchments that ever charmed the
longing eyes of a Jonathan <span class='sc'>Oldbuck</span>—or a Harris
<span class='sc'>Nicolas</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Harris, directly he received this piece of news from
Paris, passed it on to his friend the late Lord <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span>,
then Speaker, who, in turn, communicated the information
to Sir H. <span class='sc'>Ellis</span>, for the use of the Trustees. <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> was
sent to France—whither indeed he had, just at that moment,
arranged to go, in order to spend part of his holidays in
Paris, according to his frequent custom.</p>

<p class='c011'>He reached Pomard (two hundred and fifty miles from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>Paris) in September, 1829, and found a vast body of
charters which had formed the archives of the mediæval
Earls of Blois, together with many heraldic and genealogical
manuscripts chiefly relating to French families. But he
found hardly any manuscripts which bore, directly, upon
English history or affairs—the immediate object, it must
be remembered, of the mission given him by the Trustees.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Sir Henry Ellis’s report on the Historical MSS. at Pomard.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Immediately on his return to Paris, Sir Henry wrote
thus to the Archbishop of <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span>:—‘The Collection
is indeed a most extraordinary one of its kind, and would
be a treasure in the stores of the British Museum, or of
any other public Collection, though, perhaps, for a reason
which will presently appear, some of the Trustees may
think a public library of France would be its most appropriate
repository.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1829, September.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It is placed in two attics of the Chateau,
of considerable area—and I should say sixteen feet in
height—in cartons (or paste-board boxes), each two feet in
length by one in depth and width. Each carton contains
some hundreds of charters, at least whenever I examined
them, and I made here and there my comparison with the
catalogue of from twenty to thirty cartons, all answering
to the catalogue and to the successive dates upon the
outside of the boxes.... In one room there were above
a hundred boxes piled up to the ceiling, the lower ones of
which, where I could get at them, were full of instruments
arranged as I have described. I counted also, in the same
room, near a hundred and fifty bundles, all of single articles,
partly piled up for want of room, and placed upon the floors.
In the second room I counted a hundred and forty-nine
cartons piled up like the former, and no ladder in the house
to get at them. I did what I could upon a pair of steps
made of two thin boards fastened to two other upright
boards, but I had not even a safe pair of steps. Many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>the cartons in the second room contained collections of a
comparatively recent date, apparently the manuscripts of
the Baron’s father. Some of these were terriers of lands,
others were marked <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“<cite>Pays Étrangers</cite>,” “<cite>Monumens
Généalogiques</cite>;” “<cite>Pièces Historiques</cite>;” “<cite>Parlement</cite>;”
“<cite>Histoire de l’Église</cite>.”</span>’</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of the great collection of charters (and it appeared to
me to be larger than all the collection of charters at present
in the British Museum put together), I am bound to say
that I believe them to have formed almost the entire muniments
of the Earls of <span class='sc'>Blois</span>, containing whatever related to
their concern in the wars of Europe in the middle ages, to
their prædial possessions, their granting out of property
and privileges, sales, feudal or public acts, quittances of
money for military services, letters patents, expenses of
household, and every act, material or immaterial, likely to
be found in the archives of one of the greatest houses of
England.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Paucity of English Documents in the Archives at Pomard.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>‘I looked in vain, however, for anything illustrative of
English history, except in a single bundle, tied in paper,
which seemed unconnected with the cartons, and was not,
as far as I could find, in any of the MS. catalogues. This
bundle was entitled, in a modern hand, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Documens relatifs
à l’occupation de la France par les Anglais, 1400</span>.” It
consists of about one hundred vellum instruments, one or
two, or perhaps more, so far in the form of letters that they
were official announcements; such as the Duke of <span class='sc'>Orleans</span>
in England in 1437, that he had obtained safe conducts
for his Chancellor and Premier Écuyer d’écurie. Amongst
these are various orders of payment and acquittances for
money, and several relate to Charles, Duke of <span class='sc'>Orleans</span>,
whilst prisoner in England after the fight of Agincourt.
There is a payment to the Earl of <span class='sc'>Suffolk</span>; another to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>persons fighting against the English; a payment for the
deliverance of the Duc d’<span class='sc'>Angouleme</span> whilst a prisoner in
England in 1412; various orders of John, Duke of <span class='sc'>Bedford</span>,
the Bastard of Salisbury, the Duke of <span class='sc'>Exeter</span>, &amp;c.,
to persons in the care of military posts under them; the
Duke of <span class='sc'>Bedford</span> concerning musters; <span class='sc'>Henry the
Fifth’s</span> acquittance to the parishioners of certain villages
for payments on account of the war; various grants of
the same King for services in the wars; a grant to Sir
William <span class='sc'>Bourchier</span> of the estates of the Earl of <span class='sc'>Eu</span>, dated
at Mantes in his seventh year; and an order for a confirmation
to be made out of the different grants of the Kings
of England and Dukes of Normandy to the House of
Lepers at Dieppe.’</p>

<p class='c011'>When Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> had completed at Pomard that
rough examination of the Collection which he thus described
on his return to Paris, his first inquiry of the
owner was, of course, about price. M. de <span class='sc'>Joursanvault</span>
was embarrassed. To Sir Thomas <span class='sc'>Croft</span> he had already
said that he hoped to get sixty thousand francs. <span class='sc'>Ellis</span>
had noticed, as the Baron drove him from Beaune into the
court-yard of the old chateau, that its appearance denoted
wealth in past rather than in present days, but he could
hardly have been prepared for the effect of altered circumstances
in turning a gentleman into a chapman. In the
evening the anticipated sixty thousand francs had grown
into a hundred and ten thousand. Nor was this the only
demand. The Duke of <span class='sc'>Wellington</span> must use his credit
at Paris to transform the Baron into a Count (without any
stipulation for an entailed estate by way of ‘majorat’); and
if the task should be beyond the powers even of the conqueror
of <span class='sc'>Napoleon</span>, then M. de <span class='sc'>Joursanvault</span> was to
receive, from the English Government, authority to import
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>into England five hundred pipes of Beaune wine, grown
upon his own estate, free of all customs duties, and for his
own profit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Henry (who with great good sense had already taken
precaution that his position at the British Museum should
not be known to his host at Pomard, in the hope of precluding
any exaggeration of terms) remonstrated against
the burden of such a demand, but all entreaty was vain.
The Baron was bent on having—in addition to his £4400—either
a step in nobility, or, at the least, a handsome remission
of customs duty. The Trustees, in the end,
declined to treat.</p>

<p class='c010'>When it came to Sir Harris <span class='sc'>Nicolas’s</span> knowledge that
<span class='sc'>Ellis’s</span> journey to Pomard was apparently to have no result
in the way of bringing historical manuscripts into England,
he felt angry as well as disappointed. It was his earnest
belief—whether right or wrong—that a valuable occasion
had been somewhat trifled with. He told the story,<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c013'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>treasured up the memory, and both the story and the narrator’s
personal reminiscences of the transaction had their
share in bringing about the parliamentary enquiry into the
affairs of the British Museum.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Parliamentary Inquiry into Museum affairs of 1835 and 1836.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Originally, and immediately, that inquiry was proposed
to the House of Commons by Mr. Benjamin <span class='sc'>Hawes</span>, then
M.P. for Lambeth, at the instance of a Mr. John <span class='sc'>Millard</span>,
who had been employed, for some years, on an Index of
MSS., and whose employment (upon very good grounds)
had been discontinued. Sir Harris <span class='sc'>Nicolas</span> also brought
his influence to bear. Mr. <span class='sc'>Hawes</span>, personally, had a very
earnest intention to benefit the Public by the inquiry. But
his own pursuits in life were not such as to have given him
the literary qualifications necessary for conducting it.
With not less wisdom than modesty, when he had carried
his motion for a Select Committee, he waived his claim to
its chairmanship. The Committee chose for that office Mr.
<span class='sc'>Sotheron Estcourt</span>. The burden of examination, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>behalf of the Trustees, was borne—it need not be said
how ably—by men of no less mark than Sir Robert Harry
<span class='sc'>Inglis</span> and the late Earl of <span class='sc'>Derby</span>, then Lord Stanley.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the best results of the appointment of that
Committee of 1835–36 was the opportunity it gave to
Mr. <span class='sc'>Baber</span> and to Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> of advocating the claims
of the National Library to largely increased liberality on
the part of Parliament. The latter, in particular, did it
with an earnestness, and with a vivacity and felicity of
argument and of illustration, which I believe won for him
the respect of every person who enjoyed (as I did) the
pleasure of listening to his examination. I do not think
that anybody in that Committee Room of 1836 thought
his arguments a whit the weaker for being expressed by
‘a foreigner.’ But it chances to be within my knowledge
that pressure was put upon Mr. <span class='sc'>Hawes</span>, as a conspicuous
member of the Committee, to induce him to put questions
to a certain witness with the view of enabling that witness
to attack the Trustees for appointing a foreigner to an important
office in the Museum. The ludicrous absurdity of
an objection on that score—in relation to a great establishment
of Literature and Science—was not, it seems, felt in
those days as it would assuredly be felt in the present day.
The absurdity did not strike the mind of Mr. <span class='sc'>Hawes</span>,
but, to his great credit, he steadfastly refused to admit of
any impeachment in the Committee of a choice which he
believed had been most fitly made in all other respects.<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c013'><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>It is more than probable that the ability which Mr.
<span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> had displayed in the Committee Room of the
House of Commons, as well as the zeal for our national
honour which he had shown himself to possess, had something
to do in preparing the way for the promotion which
awaited him within a few months after Mr. <span class='sc'>Hawes’</span>
Committee made its final report to the House. But
his labours in the Museum itself had certainly given
substantial and ample warrant for that promotion—under
all the circumstances of the case—as will be seen
presently.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Mr. Panizzi’s appointment to the Keepership of Printed Books.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Amongst the duties entrusted to Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> after his
entrance (in 1831) into the service of the Trustees as an
extra Assistant-Librarian, was the cataloguing of an extraordinary
Collection of Tracts illustrative of the History of
the French Revolution. He had laboured on a difficult
task with great diligence and with uncommon ability. In
1835, a Committee of Trustees reported, in the highest
terms, on the performance of his duties, and concluded
their report with a recommendation which, although the
general body of Trustees did not act upon it, became the
occasion of a very eulogistic minute. Two years afterwards,
the office of Keeper of Printed Books became vacant
by the resignation of the Reverend Henry Hervey <span class='sc'>Baber</span>,
who had filled it, with great credit, from the year
1802.</p>

<p class='c011'>The office of Senior Assistant-Librarian in that Department
was then filled by another man of eminent literary
distinction, the Reverend Henry Francis <span class='sc'>Cary</span>, who, as one
of the best among the many English translators of <span class='sc'>Dante</span>,
is not likely to be soon forgotten amongst us. Not a few
Englishmen of the generation that is now passing away
learnt in his version to love <span class='sc'>Dante</span>, before they were able to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>read him in his proper garb, and learnt too to love Italy,
as <span class='sc'>Cary</span> loved it, for <span class='sc'>Dante’s</span> sake.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary</span> was the grandson of Mordecai <span class='sc'>Cary</span>, Bishop of
Killaloe, and the son of a Captain in the British Army, who at
the time of Henry <span class='sc'>Cary’s</span> birth was quartered at Gibraltar,
where the boy was born on the sixth of December, 1772.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Life and

labours of
Henry
Francis
Cary.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He
was educated at Birmingham and at Christ Church, Oxford.
It was in his undergraduate days at Christ Church that he
began to translate the <cite>Inferno</cite>, although he did not publish
his first volume until he had entered his thirty-third year,
and had established himself in ‘the great wen’ as Reader at
Berkeley Chapel (1805). <span class='sc'>Cary’s</span> ‘<cite>Dante</cite>’ soon won its
way to fame. Among other blessings it brought about his
life-long friendship with <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span> and with the Coleridgian
circle. He now became an extensive contributor to
the literary periodicals. In 1816, he was made Preacher at
the Savoy. In 1825, he offered himself to the Trustees of
the British Museum as a candidate for the Keepership of
the Department of Antiquities in succession to Taylor
<span class='sc'>Combe</span>. That office was given, with great propriety, to
Mr. Edward <span class='sc'>Hawkins</span>, who had assisted Mr. <span class='sc'>Combe</span>, and
had, in fact, replaced him during his illness. But Mr.
<span class='sc'>Cary</span> had met with encouragement—especially from the
Archbishop of <span class='sc'>Canterbury</span>—and kept a bright look-out
for new vacancies. In May or June, 1826, he wrote to his
father that he had learnt that the office of Assistant-Librarian
in the Department of Printed Books was vacant.
It had been, he added, held by a most respectable old
clergyman of the name of <span class='sc'>Bean</span>, and Mr. <span class='sc'>Bean</span> was just
dead. Within a week or two, Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary</span> was appointed
to be his successor. By a large circle of friends the appointment
was hailed as a fitting tribute to a most deserving
man of letters.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>The homely rooms in the Court-yard of the Museum
allotted to the Assistant-Keeper of the Printed Book Department
were soon the habitual resort of a cluster of poets. The
faces of <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span>, <span class='sc'>Rogers</span>, Charles <span class='sc'>Lamb</span>,<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c013'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and (during
their occasional visits to London) those of <span class='sc'>Southey</span> and
of <span class='sc'>Wordsworth</span>, became, in those days, very familiar at
the gate of old Montagu House. <span class='sc'>Coleridge</span> had always
loved <span class='sc'>Cary</span>, and when the charms of long monologues,
delivered at the Grove to devout listeners, withheld him
from visits, the correspondence between Highgate and
Bloomsbury became so frequent and so voluminous, that
he is said to have endeavoured to persuade Sir Francis
<span class='sc'>Freeling</span> that all correspondence to or from the British
Museum ought to be officially regarded as ‘On His Majesty’s
Service,’ and to be franked, to any weight, accordingly.
But those love-enlivened rooms were, in a very few
years, to be darkly clouded. <span class='sc'>Cary</span> lost his wife on the
twenty-second of November, 1832, and almost immediately
afterwards—so dreadful was the blow to him—‘a look of
mere childishness, approaching to a suspension of vitality,
marked the countenance which had but now beamed with
intellect.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Life of H. F.
Cary</cite>, by his
Son, vol. ii,
p. 198.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Such are the words of his fellow-mourner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Part of Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary’s</span> duties at the Museum now necessarily
fell, for a few months, to be discharged by Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span><span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, who, in the preceding year, had been appointed
next in office to <span class='sc'>Cary</span>. The circumstances of that appointment
have been thus stated by the eminent Prelate who
made it:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Circumstances of Mr. Panizzi’s first appointment in 1831.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>‘Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> was entirely unknown to me, except by
reputation. I understood that he was a civilian who had
come from Italy, and that he was a man of great acquirements
and talents, peculiarly well suited for the British
Museum. That was represented to me by several persons
who were not connected with the Museum, and it was
strongly pressed by several of the Trustees, who were of
opinion that Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> appointment would be very
advantageous for the institution.

of that gentleman, his knowledge of foreign
languages, his eminent ability and extensive attainments, I
could not doubt the propriety of acceding to their wishes.’</p>

<p class='c011'>When that appointment was made, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> had
already passed almost ten years in England.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Mr.
Panizzi’s
early
career and
his labours
in England.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The greater
part of them had been spent at Liverpool, as a tutor in the
language and literature of Italy. Born at Brescello, in the
Duchy of Modena, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> had been educated at
Reggio and at Parma; in the last-named University he
had graduated as LL.D. in 1818; and he had practised
with distinction as an advocate. Part of his leisure hours
had been given to the study of bibliography, and to the
acquisition of a library. But he was an ardent aspirant
for the liberty of Italy, and, in 1820, narrowly escaped
becoming one of its many martyrs. After the unsuccessful
rising of that year in Piedmont, he was arrested at
Cremona, but escaped from his prison. After his escape
he was sentenced to death. He sought a refuge first at
Lugano, and afterwards at Geneva. But his ability had
made him a marked man. Austrian spies dogged his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>steps, and appealed, by turns, to the suspicions and to the
fears of the local authorities. Presently it seemed clear
that England, alone, would afford, to the dreaded ‘conspirator’
for Italy, a secure abode. At Liverpool he acquired
the friendship successively of Ugo <span class='sc'>Foscolo</span>, of
<span class='sc'>Roscoe</span>, and of <span class='sc'>Brougham</span>. In 1828, he received and
accepted the offer of the Professorship of Italian Literature
in the then London University, now ‘University College.’
In 1830, he began the publication of his admirable edition
of the poems of <span class='sc'>Bojardo</span> and <span class='sc'>Ariosto</span>, which was completed
in 1834.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><cite>Minutes of Evidence on the Constitution and Management of the British Museum</cite>, 26 May, 1848, § 2764 (Report of 1850, p. 114).</div>

<p class='c011'>When Mr. <span class='sc'>Baber</span> announced, in March, 1837, his intention
to resign his Keepership, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> made no
application for the office, but he wrote to the Principal
Trustees an expression of his hope that if, in the event,
‘any appointment was to take place on account of Mr.
<span class='sc'>Baber’s</span> resignation,’ his services would be borne in
mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>One of Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary’s</span> earliest steps in the matter was to
apply to his friend and fellow-poet, Mr. Samuel <span class='sc'>Rogers</span>.
<span class='sc'>Rogers</span>—to use his own words—was one who had known
<span class='sc'>Cary</span> ‘in all weathers.’ His earnest friendship induced
him to write a letter of recommendation to the three Principal
Trustees. After he had sent in his recommendation,
a genuine conscientiousness—not the less truly characteristic
of the man for all that outward semblance of cynicism
which frequently veiled it—prompted him to think the
matter over again. It occurred to him to doubt whether
he was really serving his old friend <span class='sc'>Cary</span> by helping to put
him in a post for which failing vigour was but too obviously,
though gradually, unfitting him. His misgiving increased
the more he turned the affair over in his mind. He
then wrote three letters (to the Archbishop, Chancellor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>and Speaker), recalling his recommendation, and stating
his reason. With the Speaker, <span class='sc'>Rogers</span> also conversed on
the subject. Mr. <span class='sc'>Abercromby</span> asked the poet: ‘What do
you know about a Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, who stands next to <span class='sc'>Cary</span>?’
‘<span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>,’ said <span class='sc'>Rogers</span>, ‘would serve you very well.’ ‘To
tell you the truth,’ rejoined the Speaker, ‘we think that, if
Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary</span> is not appointed, <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> will be the right
man.’ At that time, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> was not personally
known either to the Speaker or to the Chancellor.</p>

<p class='c011'>I give these details, first, because they became, in after-days,
a very vital and influential part of the History of the
British Museum. No appointment was ever made during
the whole of the hundred and fifteen years which have
elapsed betwixt the first organization of the establishment
in 1755 and the year in which I write (1870) that has had
such large influence upon its growth and its improvement;
and, secondly, because in a published life of the excellent
man whose temporary disappointment led to a great public
benefit a passage appears which (doubtless very unintentionally,
but not the less seriously) misrepresents the matter,
and hints, mysteriously, at underhanded influence, as
though something had been done in the way of treachery
to <span class='sc'>Cary</span>. ‘The Lord Chancellor and the Speaker,’ writes
<span class='sc'>Cary’s</span> biographer, ‘acting under information, <em>the source of
which was probably known only to them and their informant</em>,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Life of Henry
Francis Cary</cite>,
vol. ii, p. 200.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
resolved on passing him over, and appointing his subordinate,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, to the vacant place.’</p>

<p class='c011'>These letters and conversations passed in the interval
between the announcement that there would be a vacancy
in the Museum staff and its actual occurrence. The
Keepership became vacant on the twenty-fourth of June.
On that day Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary</span> made his personal application to the
Archbishop. The Archbishop told him that objections were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>made to his appointment. <span class='sc'>Cary</span>, immediately after his
return, told his brother-officers <span class='sc'>Baber</span> and <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> what
the Archbishop had communicated to him. ‘Then,’ said
Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, ‘the thing concerns me.’ ‘Yes,’ rejoined
<span class='sc'>Cary</span>, ‘certainly it does.’ They all knew that applications
for the vacant office from outsiders were talked of. Among
these were the late Reverend Ernest <span class='sc'>Hawkins</span> and the late
Reverend Richard <span class='sc'>Garnett</span> (who afterwards succeeded to
the Assistant-Librarianship). And Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> then
proceeded to say to Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary</span>: ‘You will not, now, object
to my asking for the place myself, as there are these objections
to you.’ <span class='sc'>Cary</span> replied, ‘Not at all.’ Instantly,
and in <span class='sc'>Cary’s</span> presence, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> wrote thus to the
Archbishop:—‘I hope your Grace will not deem it presumptuous
in me to beg respectfully of your Grace and the
other Principal Trustees to take my case into consideration,
should they think it necessary to depart from the usual
system of regular promotion, on appointing Mr. <span class='sc'>Baber’s</span>
successor.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Panizzi to the
Archbishop of
Canterbury,
26 June, 1837
(<cite>Minutes of
Evidence of
1850</cite>).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I venture to say thus much, having been informed
by Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary</span> of the conversation he has had the
honour to have with your Grace.’ The writer gave his
letter into Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary’s</span> hand, received his brother-officer’s
immediate approval, and had that approval, at a later hour
of the day and after a re-perusal of the letter, confirmed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within the walls of the Museum, the general feeling
was so strongly in favour of Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary’s</span> appointment,
despite all objection (and nothing can be more natural than
that it should be so—‘A fellow-feeling makes us wondrous
kind’), that the <em>public</em> interest, in having an officer who
would use the appointment rather as a working-tool than
as a reclining staff, was, for the moment, lost sight of. Sir
Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> himself, when asked to give a formal testimonial
of Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> qualifications to be head of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>Printed Book Department, answered: ‘If you told me that
the Bodleian Librarianship was vacant—or any other outside
Librarianship worth your having—you should have my
heartiest recommendation. At present, you must excuse
me;’ or in words to that effect. Edward <span class='sc'>Hawkins</span>, then
Keeper of the Department of Antiquities, expressed himself
(in the hearing of the present writer) to like purpose,
when asked what his opinion was on a point which, at the
moment, attracted not a little attention in literary circles.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c013'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Cary</span> afterwards—and when it was too late to recall it—regretted
his assent to Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> application. He
applied again to the Archbishop, and obtained something
like a promise of support. He wrote several letters to the
Lord Chancellor. In one of these he (unconsciously, as it
seems) adduced a conclusive argument against his own
appointment to the office he sought. He wrote that, as he
was informed, the objections of his Lordship and of the
Speaker were twofold: the one resting on his age, and the
other on the state of his health. He answered the objections
in these words:—‘My age, it is plain, might rather
ask for me that <em>alleviation of labour</em> which, <em>in this as in
other public offices, is gained by promotion</em> to a superior
place, than call for a continuance of the same laborious
employment.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Cary to the
Lord Chancellor,
18
July, 1837
(<cite>The Times</cite>).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
What must have been a Lord Chancellor’s
ruminations upon the ‘alleviation of labour’ which ‘a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>superior place’ brings to a public servant, is a somewhat
amusing subject of conjecture.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was with perfect honesty and integrity of purpose that
Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary</span> adduced medical testimony of his fitness for continued
but diminished labours. He would have exerted
himself to the best of his ability. But it was a blemish in
an excellent man that (under momentary irritation) he twice
permitted himself to reproach his competitor and colleague
with being ‘a foreigner.’</p>

<p class='c011'>One would fain have hoped that our famous countryman
Daniel <span class='sc'>Defoe</span> had, a hundred years before, put all reproach
and contumely on the score of a man’s <em>not</em> being a ‘true-born
Englishman’ quite out of Court, in all contentions
concerning capabilities of public service. But, of all places
in the world, a <span class='sc'>Museum</span> is the queerest place in which to
raise petty questions of nationality. If it be at all worthy
of its name, its contents must have come from the four
quarters of the globe. Men of every race under Heaven
must have worked hard to furnish it. It brings together
the plants of Australia; the minerals of Peru; the shells of
the far Pacific; the manuscripts which had been painfully
compiled or transcribed by twenty generations of labourers
in every corner of Europe, as well as in the monasteries of
Africa and of the Eastern Desert; and the sculptures and the
printed books of every civilised country in the world. And
then it is proposed—when arrangements are to be made for
turning dead collections into living fountains of knowledge—that
the question asked shall be: <em>not</em> ‘What is your
capacity to administer?’ but ‘Where were you born?’ I
hope, and I believe, that in later years Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary</span> regretted
that he had permitted a name so deservedly honoured to
endorse so poor a sophism.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>Mr. Antonio <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> received his appointment on the
fifteenth of July, 1837. If he had worked hard to gain
promotion, he worked double tides to vindicate it. In the
following month, Mr. <span class='sc'>Cary</span> resigned his Assistant-Librarianship.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Panizzi’s
appointment
as
Keeper of
the Printed
Books</span>, July,
1837.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He left the Museum with the hearty respect and
with the brotherly regrets of all his colleagues, without any
exception. Of him, it may very truly be said, he was a man
much beloved.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor was it otherwise with Mr. <span class='sc'>Baber</span>. His public
services began in old Bodley towards the end of the year
1796, and they were so efficient as to open to him, at the
beginning of the present century, a subordinate post in the
British Museum, his claims to which he waived the instant
that he knew they would stand in the way of <span class='sc'>Ellis</span>, his early
friend of undergraduate days. He became Assistant-Librarian
in 1807; Keeper of Printed Books in 1812. He, too, was
a man with no enemies. In literature he won (before he was
fifty) an enduring place by his edition of the <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vetus Testamentum
Græcum e Codice MS. Alexandrino&#160;... descriptum</span></cite>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the amiability of character which distinguished Mr.
<span class='sc'>Baber</span>, not less than did his scholarship, the present writer
had more than common experience. It was my fortune
to make my first intimate acquaintance (1835) with the
affairs of the British Museum in the capacity of a critic on
that part of Mr. <span class='sc'>Baber’s</span> discharge of his manifold functions
as Keeper which related to the increase of the Library, both
by purchase and by the operation of the Copyright Act.
I criticised some of his doings, and some of his omissions to
do, with youthful presumption, and with that self-confident
half-knowledge which often leads a man more astray, practically,
than does sheer ignorance. So far from resenting
strictures, a few of which may have had some small validity
and value, while a good many were certainly plausible but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>shallow, he turned the former to profit, and, so far from
resenting the latter, repeatedly evinced towards their
author acts of courtesy and kindness. It was in his
company that I first explored—as we strode from beam to
beam of the unfinished flooring—the new Library rooms
in which, long afterwards, I was to perform my humble
spell of work on the <cite>Catalogue of the Printed Books</cite>; as he
had performed his hard-by almost thirty years earlier.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Baber</span> survived his retirement from his Keepership
(in 1837) no less than thirty-two years. He died, on the
twenty-eighth of March, 1869, at his rectory-house at Stretham,
in the Isle of Ely, and in his 94th year. He had then
been F.R.S. for fifty-three years, and had survived his old
friend Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> by a few weeks. He served his
parishioners in Cambridgeshire, as he had served his country
in London, with unremitting zeal and punctual assiduity.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> earliest employments in his new
office of 1837 was to make arrangements for the formidable
task of transferring the whole mass of the old Library from
Montagu House to the new Building, but he also did something
immediately towards preparing the way for that systematic
enlargement of the Collection of Printed Books which
he had formerly and so earnestly pressed on the attention, not
merely of the Select Committee of the House of Commons in
1835–36, but of every Statesman and Parliament-man whose
ear he could gain, whether (in his interlocutor’s opinion) in
season or out of season. To use the expression of the man
who, at a later date, mainly helped him in that task,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> leading thought, in regard to Public Libraries,
was that Paris must be surpassed. In common with others
of us who, like himself, had been examined before Mr.
<span class='sc'>Hawes’</span> Committee on that subject, he had brought into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>salient relief some points of superiority which foreign
countries possessed over Britain, but the ruling motive
of the unsavoury comparison was British improvement,
not, most assuredly, British discredit.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the formidable business of the transfer of the bulk of
the National Library, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> received his best help
from a man now just lost to us, but whose memory will
surely survive. Exactly six months after his own appointment
to the headship of his Department, he introduced
into the permanent service of the Trustees Mr. Thomas
<span class='sc'>Watts</span>.

Thomas
Watts.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The readers of such a volume as this will not, I
imagine, think it to be a digression if I here make some
humble attempt to record what was achieved by my old
acquaintance—an acquaintance of almost one and thirty
years’ standing—both in his varied literary labours and in
his long and fruitful service at the Museum.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thomas <span class='sc'>Watts</span> was born in London in the year 1811.
He was educated at a private school in London, where he
was very early noted for the possession of three several
qualities, one or other of which is found, in a marked
degree, in thousands of men and in tens of thousands of precocious
boys, but the union of all of which, whether in child
or in man, is rare indeed. Young <span class='sc'>Watts</span> evinced both an
astonishing capacity for acquiring languages—the most far
remote from his native speech—and an unusual readiness
at English composition. He had also a knack for turning
off very neat little speeches and recitations. Before he
was fifteen, he could give good entertainment at a breaking up
or a ‘speech-day.’ Before he was twenty, he had gained
his footing as a contributor to periodical literature.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c013'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>In the autumn of the year 1835, Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts’</span> attention
was attracted to the publication of the <cite>Minutes of Evidence
taken before the Select Committee on the British Museum</cite>, the
first portion of which had been ordered to be printed, by
the House of Commons, in the preceding August.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Watts’
early
interest in
the improvement
of the
British
Museum.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He
read the evidence with great interest, and ere long he wrote
(in 1836 and 1837) some valuable comments upon it, which
embodied several suggestions for the improvement of the
Museum service, and for making it increasedly accessible
to the Public. More than two or three of the suggestions
so offered, he lived to carry out—long afterwards, by his
own exertions, and with the cordial approval of his superior
officer, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>—into practice, after he had himself
entered into the service of the Trustees as an Assistant in
the Printed Book Department.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he chose a very unfortunate medium for his useful
communications of 1836 and 1837. He printed them in
the columns of the ‘<cite>Mechanics’ Magazine</cite>,’ where, for practical
purposes, they were almost buried. Of this fact I am
able to give a small illustrative and personal instance.
Possibly, it may be thought to have some little biographical
value, as a trait of his character.</p>

<p class='c011'>In both of the years above named Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span> did the
present writer the honour to make some remarks on his
humble labours for the improvement of the Museum in
1835 and 1836. Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts’</span> remarks were very complimentary
and kind in their expression. But I never saw or
heard of them, until this year, 1870, after their writer had
passed from the knowledge of the many acquaintances and
friends who, in common with myself, much esteemed him,
and who will ever honour his memory.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>One of the communications which my late friend published
in that ‘<cite>Mechanics’ Magazine</cite>’ contained two suggestions—made
contingently, and by way of alternative plans—for
the enlargement of the Museum buildings. Nearly
eleven years afterwards (August, 1847), I unconsciously
repeated those very suggestions, amongst many others, in
a pamphlet, entitled <cite>Public Libraries in London and Paris</cite>.
I was in complete ignorance that my suggestions of 1847
were otherwise than entirely original. I thought them
wholly my own. Of the print which accompanied my
pamphlet I give the reader an exact fac-simile, errors included,
on the opposite plate. The print embodied very
nearly the same thoughts, on the enlargement of the library,
which had been expressed, so long before, in the pages of
the ‘<cite>Mechanics’ Magazine</cite>.’ The first presented copy of
that pamphlet and print was given to my friend <span class='sc'>Watts</span>.
I was then absent, far from London, and I had presently
the pleasure of receiving from him a long letter, containing
some criticisms and remarks on my publication. But such
was his modest reticence about his own prior performance,
that the letter contained no word or hint concerning the
anticipation of my alternative suggestions for the enlargement
of the Library in his prior publication. And, in the
long interval between 1837 and 1847, I suppose we had
conversed about the improvement of the Museum, and
about its buildings, actual and prospective, some thirty or
forty times, but (as I have said) those valuable and thoughtful
articles of his, printed in 1836–7—and making complimentary
mention of my own labours, and of my evidence
given before Mr. <span class='sc'>Hawes’</span> Committee—never came within
my knowledge. No part of their contents was even mentioned
to me. I saw them, for the first time, in January,
1870. Very few men—within my range of acquaintance—had so much dislike to talk of their performances, as was
manifested by Thomas <span class='sc'>Watts</span>. To this day, very much of
what he did for the Public is scarcely known even by those
who (at one time or other) enjoyed the pleasure, and the
honour, of his friendship. He was one of the men who
‘did good by stealth,’ and would have almost blushed to
find it fame.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Watts’ labours for the augmentation of the British Museum Library.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>When Thomas <span class='sc'>Watts</span> entered the Museum, the immediate
task entrusted to him, onerous as it was, did not (for
any long time) engross his attention. In common with
Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, his desire to increase the Library, and to
make London surpass Paris—‘<em>Paris must be surpassed</em>,’
are the words which close the best of those articles, printed
in 1837, to which I have just now referred—amounted
to a positive passion. He did not talk very much about
it; but I fancy it occupied, not only his waking thoughts,
but his very dreams.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> had not been at the head of his Department
many weeks before he began a Special Report to the
Trustees, recommending a systematic increase of the Collection
of Printed Books.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the autumn of 1837 he could hardly foresee that
one of the attacks to be made, in the after-years, upon
those who had appointed him, or who had promoted
his appointment, for the crime of preferring ‘a foreigner’
to a high post in our National Museum, would be based
upon the foreigner’s neglect of English Literature. ‘An
Italian Librarian,’ said those profound logicians, ‘must,
naturally and necessarily, swamp the Library with Italian
books. He can’t help doing it.’ But, strange as it may have
seemed to objectors of that calibre, this particular Italian
happened to be, not only a scholar—a ripe and good one—but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>a man of wide sympathies, and of catholic tastes in
literature. He was able himself to enjoy <span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>,
not less thoroughly than he was able, by his critical acumen,
to increase other men’s enjoyment of <span class='sc'>Ariosto</span> and of <span class='sc'>Dante</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Sir A. Panizzi’s Report, in October, 1837, on the proper characteristics of a National Library for Great Britain.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In October, 1837, he wrote thus:—‘With respect to the
purchase of books, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> begs to lay before the
Trustees the general principles by which he will be guided,
if not otherwise directed, in endeavouring to answer the
expectations and wishes of the Trustees and of the Public
in this respect. First, the attention of the Keeper of this
emphatically British Library ought to be directed, most
particularly, to British works, and to works relating to the
British Empire; its religious, political, and literary, as well
as scientific history; its laws, institutions, description, commerce,
arts, &amp;c. The rarer and more expensive a work of
this description is, the more indefatigable<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c013'><sup>[30]</sup></a> efforts ought to
be made to secure it for the Library. Secondly, the old
and rare, as well as the critical, editions of ancient Classics,
ought never to be sought for in vain in this Collection. Nor
ought good comments, as also the best translations into
modern languages, to be wanting. Thirdly, with respect to
foreign literature, arts, and sciences, the Library ought to
possess the best editions of standard works for critical
purposes or for use. The Public have, moreover, a right
to find, in their National Library, heavy as well as expensive
foreign works, such as <cite>Literary Journals</cite>; <cite>Transactions
of Societies</cite>; large Collections, historical or otherwise; complete
series of Newspapers; Collections of Laws, and their
best interpreters.’ We have, in this brief passage, the germ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>of the admirable Report on the National Library, written
on a far more extended scale, which was afterwards laid
before the Government, and, ultimately, before Parliament.</p>

<p class='c011'>If this Report failed to lead, immediately (or, indeed,
for a long time to come), to the increased means of acquisition
on which its writer’s mind was so much bent, the
fault did not lie in the Trustees. It lay with the House of
Commons, and with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The impediments in the way of improvement.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>It is hard to realise, in 1870, how entirely the effort
for an adequate improvement of the British Museum was an
uphill task. Trustees like the late Lord <span class='sc'>Derby</span> and the
late Sir R. H. <span class='sc'>Inglis</span> were earnestly desirous to carry out
such recommendations as those of Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, but the
employment of urging them on the Ministry was an ungrateful
one. In those days of reforming-activity, although,
in 1837, the average radicals in ‘the House’ were not quite
such devout believers in the faith that a general overturn
was the only road to a general millenium as they had been
in 1832, they were willing enough to listen to attacks
upon the managers of any public institution (no matter
how crude were the views of the assailants, or how lopsided
their information), but they were not half so ready to
open the public purse-strings in order to enable impugned
managers or trustees to improve the institution entrusted
to them upon a worthy scale.</p>

<p class='c011'>Three months after writing his Report of 1837, Mr.
<span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> was enabled to procure the official assistance of
Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span>. The appointment strengthened his hands,
by giving to a man of extraordinary powers for organization
and government, the services of a man not less
extraordinary for his powers of accumulating and assimilating
detail. What each man characteristically possessed,
was just the right supplement to the special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>faculties of the other. But even such a happy union of
personal qualities would have failed to carry into effect the
large aspirations for the improvement of the Museum which
both men, severally and independently, had cherished
(during many years), but for one other circumstance.
This was a merely incidental—one might say a fortuitous—circumstance;
but it proved very influential upon the fortunes
of the British Museum in the course of the years to
come.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See hereafter,
Chap. V.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
When Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> began to be known in London
society—at first, very much by the instrumentality of the
late Mr. Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>, who, at an early period, had
become warmly attached to him—his acquaintance was
eagerly cultivated. In this way he obtained opportunities
to preach his doctrine of increased public support for our
great national and educational institutions (his advocacy
was not limited within the four walls of the Museum) in
the ears of very valuable and powerful listeners. It was
thought, now and then, that he preached on that topic out
of season as well as in season. But the issue amply vindicated
the zeal which prompted him to make the pleasures of
social intercourse subserve the performance of a public trust.
Few men, I imagine—holding the unostentatious post of a
librarianship—ever possessed so many social opportunities
of the kind here referred to, as were possessed by Mr.
<span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>. And even those listeners who may have thought
him over-pertinacious, sometimes, in pressing his convictions,
must needs have carried away with them the assurance
that one public servant, at all events, did not regard
his duties as ‘irksome.’ They must have seen that this
man’s heart was in his official work.</p>

<p class='c011'>So was it also in the instance of Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> righthand
man within the Museum itself. Thomas <span class='sc'>Watts</span> was
not gifted with powers of persuasive argument. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>address and manners did no sort of justice to the intrinsic
qualities, or to the true heart, of the man himself. To
strangers, they often gave a most inaccurate idea of his
faculties and character. Under the outward guise of a
blunt-spoken farmer, there dwelt, not only high scholarship,
but a lofty sense—it would not be too strong to say a
passionate sense—of public duty. He had none of the
persuasive gifts of vivid talk. But he could preach
forcibly, by example. When he had made some way with
the first task which was assigned him, that of superintending
the removal of the Library, and its due ordering—in
some of the details of which he was ably assisted, almost
from the outset, by Mr. George <span class='sc'>Bullen</span> (who, in January,
1838, was first specially employed to retranscribe the
press-marks or symbols of the books, as they stood in
old Montagu House, into the new equivalents necessitated
by their altered position in the new Library, in which
labour he was, in the April following, assisted by Mr.
N. W. <span class='sc'>Simons</span>)—and had solved, by assiduous effort and
self-denying labour, some of the many difficulties which
stood in the way of effecting that removal without impeding,
to any serious degree, the service of the Public
Reading-Room, he turned his attention, at Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span>
instance, to the—to him—far more grateful task of preparing
lists of foreign books for addition to the Library.
For this task he evinced special qualities and attainments
which, I believe, were never surpassed, by any librarian in
the world; not even by an <span class='sc'>Audiffredi</span>, a <span class='sc'>Van-Praet</span>, or
a <span class='sc'>Magliabechi</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Linguistic attainments of Thomas Watts.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts’</span> earliest schoolfellows had marvelled at his
faculty for acquiring with great rapidity such a degree of
familiarity with foreign tongues, as gave him an amply
sufficient master-key to their several literatures. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>yet very young, he showed a scholarly appreciation of the
right methods of setting to work. He studied languages
in groups—giving his whole mind to one group at a time,
and then passing to another. At an age when many men
(far from being blockheads) are painfully striving after a
literary command of their mother-tongue, young <span class='sc'>Watts</span>
had showed himself to be master of two several clusters of
the great Indo-European family, and to have a very
respectable acquaintance with a third. When, as a youthful
volunteer at the Museum, he was fulfilling a request
made to him by Mr. <span class='sc'>Baber</span>, that he would catalogue the
Collection of Icelandic books given to the Public, half a
century before, by Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span>, and also another
parcel of Russian books, which had been bought at his own
recommendation, the reading of Chinese literature was the
labour of his hours of private study, and the reading of
Polish literature was the recreation of his hours of leisure.</p>

<p class='c011'>What the feelings of an ambitious student of that strain
would be when officially instructed by his superior to take
under his sole (or almost sole) charge the duty of examining
the Museum Catalogues, and of obtaining from all
parts of Europe and Asia, and from many parts of America,
other catalogues of every kind, in order to ascertain the
deficiencies of the Library, and to supply them, the reader
can fancy. The new assistant luxuriated in his office.
Many of his suggestions were periodically and earnestly
supported with the Trustees by Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>. His labours
were appreciated and often (to my personal knowledge)
warmly applauded by his superior officer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>His Lists of Museum Desiderata.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>He began with making lists of Russian books that were
<em>desiderata</em> in the Museum Library; then of Hungarian;
then of Dutch; then of French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese;
then of Chinese; then of Welsh; then of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>rapidly growing, but theretofore (at the Museum) much
neglected, literature of the Americas and the Indies.</p>

<p class='c011'>I used, now and then, to watch him at his work, and to
think that no man could possibly be employed more entirely
to his liking. Long after I ceased to enjoy any opportunity
of talking with him about his employment, I used occasionally
to hear that similar tasks occupied, not infrequently,
the hours of evening leisure as well as the hours of official
duty. Some who knew him more intimately than—of late
years—it was my privilege to know him, believe that his
early death was in part (humanly speaking) due to his passion
for poring over catalogues and other records of far-off
literatures when worn-out nature needed to be refreshed,
and to be recreatively interested in quite other occupations.</p>

<p class='c011'>During the last twenty years alone (1850–1869 inclusive)
he cannot have marked and recommended for purchase
less than a hundred and fifty thousand foreign works, and
in order to their selection he must needs have examined
almost a million of book-titles, in at least eighteen different
languages.</p>

<p class='c011'>When little more than half that last-named term of years
had expired he was able to write—in a Report which he
addressed to Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> in February, 1861—that the
common object of Keeper and Assistant-Keeper had been,
during almost a quarter of a century, to ‘bring together
from all quarters the useful, the elegant, and the curious
literature of every language; to unite with the best English
Library in England, or the world, the best Russian Library
out of Russia, the best German out of Germany, the best
Spanish out of Spain, and so with every language from Italian
to Icelandic, from Polish to Portuguese. In five of the
languages in which it now claims this species of supremacy,
in Russian, Polish, Hungarian, Danish, and Swedish, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>believe I may say that, with the exception of perhaps fifty
volumes, every book that has been purchased by the
Museum within the last three and twenty years has been
purchased at my suggestion. I have the pleasure of reflecting
that every future student of the less-known literatures
of Europe will find riches where I found poverty; though,
of course, <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Reports of
1861, pp. 17,
18.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the collections in all these languages together form
but a small proportion of the vast accumulations that have
been added to the Library during your administration and
that of your successor.’<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c013'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>When the reader comes to add to his estimate of the
amount of mental labour thus briefly and modestly indicated
by the man who performed it, a thought of the
further toil involved in the re-arrangement and careful
<em>classification</em> of more than four hundred thousand volumes
of books, in all the literary languages of the world (without
any exception), he will have attained some rough idea of
the public service which was crowded into one man’s life;
and that, as we all have now to regret, not a protracted
life. He will have, too, some degree of conception of the
amount of acquired knowledge which was taken from us
when Thomas <span class='sc'>Watts</span> was taken.</p>

<p class='c011'>To his works of industry and of learning, the man we
have lost added the still better works of a kindly, benevolent
heart. Many a struggling student received at his hands
both wise and loving counsel, and active help. And his
good deeds were not advertised. They would not now
have been spoken of, but for his loss—in the very thick of
his labours for the Public.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a precious volume, which was first added to the
manuscript stores of the British Museum a little before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts’</span> death, there occurs the rough jotting of a
thought which is very apposite to our human and natural
reflections upon such an early removal from the scene of
labour as that just referred to. When somebody spoke
to <span class='sc'>Bacon</span> of the death, in the midst of duty and of mental
vigour, of some good worker or other in the vineyard of
this world, almost three centuries ago, he made the following
entry in his private note-book:—‘Princes, when in
jousts, triumphs, or games of victory, men deserve crowns
for their performance, do not crown them below, where the
deeds are performed, but call them up. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lord Bacon’s
<cite>Note-Book</cite>
(MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>
B. M.).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
So doth God by
death.’</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Other literary labours of Thomas Watts.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>But these several branches of public duty, onerous as
they were, were far from exhausting Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts’</span> mental
activity, either within the Museum walls or outside of
them. He was a frequent contributor to periodical literature.
To his pen the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> was indebted for
an excellent article on the <cite>History of Cyclopædias</cite>; the
<span class='sc'>Athenæum</span>, for a long series of papers on various topics of
literary history and of current literature, extending over
many years; the various Cyclopædias and Biographical
Dictionaries successively edited by Mr. Charles <span class='sc'>Knight</span>,
for a long series of valuable notices, embracing the Language
and Literature of Hungary; those of Wales; and more than
a hundred and thirty brief biographical memoirs, distinguished
alike for careful research and for clear and vigorous
expression. These biographies relate, for the most part, to
foreign men of letters. To the pages of the <cite>Transactions of
the Philological Society</cite> he was a frequent contributor. His
Memoir on Hungarian Literature, first read to that Society,
procured him the distinction of a corresponding-membership
of the Hungarian Academy, and the distinction was enhanced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>by his being elected on the same day with Lord
<span class='sc'>Macaulay</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within the Museum itself two distinct and important
departments of official labour, both of which he filled with
intelligence and zeal, have yet to be indicated.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The
Museum
Printed
Book Catalogue
of
1839–1869,
and Watts’
labours in
relation to
it.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In 1839,
he took part—with others—in framing an extensive code
of ‘rules’ for the re-compilation of the entire body of the
Catalogues of Printed Books. In May, 1857, he took
charge of the Public Reading-Room, as Chief Superintendent
of the daily service.</p>

<p class='c011'>It need hardly be said that the first-named task—that
on the Catalogues—was a labour of planning and shaping,
not one of actual execution. It was very important, however,
in its effects on the public economy of the Library,
and it was the one only labour, as I believe, performed
by Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span>, whether severally or in conjunction with
others, which failed to give unmixed satisfaction to the
general body of readers. The <cite>Minutes of Evidence</cite>, taken
by the Commissioners of 1848–1850, whilst they abound
in expressions of public gratitude both to Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> and,
next after him, to Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span>, contain a not less remarkable
abundance of criticisms, and of complaints, upon the plan
(not the execution) of the <cite>Catalogue of Printed Books</cite> begun
in 1839. The subject is a dry one, but will repay some
brief attention on the reader’s part.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> became Keeper, he had (it will have
been seen) to face almost instantly, and abreast, three several
tasks, each of which entailed much labour upon himself,
personally, as well as upon his assistants. The third of
them—this business of the Catalogue—proved to be not
the least onerous, and it was, assuredly, not the best
rewarded in the shape of its ultimate reception by those
concerned more immediately in its performance. I can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>speak with some sympathy on this point, since it was as a
temporary assistant in the preparation of this formidable
and keenly-criticised Catalogue, that the present writer
entered the service of the Trustees, in February, 1839.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Objections to the plan of the Museum Printed Book Catalogue (1839–1869).</span></div>

<p class='c011'>That some objections to the plan adopted in 1839 are
well-grounded I entirely believe. But the important point
in this matter, for our present purpose, is, not that the plan
preferred was unobjectionable, but that the utmost effort
was used, at the time and under the circumstances of the
time, to prepare such a Catalogue as should meet the fair
requirements both of the Trustees and of the Readers. It
is within my recollection that, to effect this, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>
laboured, personally as well as in the way of super-intendance
and direction, as it has not often happened to
me, in my time, to see men labour for the Public. Assuredly
to him promotion brought no lessening of toil in
any form.</p>

<p class='c011'>In shaping the plan of the General Catalogue of 1839–1870
(for it is, at this moment of writing, still in active
progress), the course taken was this:—A sort of committee
of five persons was formed, each of whom severally was to
prepare, in rough draft, rules for the compilation of the
projected work, illustrated by copious examples. It was
to be entirely new, and to embrace every book contained in
the Library up to the close of the year 1838. The draft
rules were then freely discussed in joint committee, and
wherever differences of opinion failed to be reconciled upon
conference, the majority of votes determined the question.
Such was Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> anxiety to prepare the best Catalogue
for the Readers that was practicable, that he never
insisted, authoritatively, on his own view of any point
whatever, which might be in contention amongst us, when
he stood in a minority. On all such points, he voted upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>an exact equality with his assistants. The rules that were
most called into question (before the Commissioners of 1848–1850)
had been severally discussed and determined in this fair
and simple way. Beyond all doubt, some of the rules might
now be largely amended in the light of subsequent experience.
But, when adopted, they seemed to <em>all</em> of us the
best that were practicable under all the then circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'>The committee thus formed consisted of Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>
himself, of Mr. Thomas <span class='sc'>Watts</span>, of Mr. John Winter <span class='sc'>Jones</span>
(now Principal-Librarian), of Mr. John Humffreys <span class='sc'>Parry</span>
(now Mr. Serjeant <span class='sc'>Parry</span>), and of the writer of this
volume. The labour was much more arduous than the
average run of readers in a Public Library have any adequate
conception of. It occupied several months. It was
pushed with such energy and industry, that many a time,
after we had all five worked together, till the light of the
spring days of 1839 failed us, we adjourned to work on—with
the help of a sandwich and a glass of Burgundy—in
Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> private apartment above the old gate in the
Court-yard. If the result of our joint labours had been
printed in the ordinary form of books, it would have made
a substantial octavo volume. The code has, no doubt,
many faults and oversights, but, be they what they may, it
was a vast improvement upon former doings in that direction;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See Mr.
Panizzi’s
evidence
before the
Commissioners
of 1848–9.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and not a little of it has been turned to account, of
late years, in the Public Libraries of France, of Germany,
and of America.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the labours of this little house-committee my late
friend took a very large share. To Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, and to
him, all their colleagues in the task of 1839 will readily
admit that the chief merit of what is good, and the smallest
part of the demerit of what may have been injudicious, in
the <cite>Rules for the Compilation of the Catalogue of Printed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>Books</cite> (now before me) is incontestably due. My own
experience in such matters, in the spring of 1839, was
small indeed. That of my friend <span class='sc'>Parry</span> was even less.
Mr. Winter <span class='sc'>Jones</span> possessed, already, the advantage of a
thorough familiarity with the Library about to be catalogued,
and also an extensive and thorough general knowledge
of books. Of Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> qualifications and
attainments, for such a labour, it would be supererogatory
and idle to say a word more, except that he had already—and
single-handed—made so good a Catalogue of the fine
Library of the Royal Society that the meddling of half a dozen
‘revisers’ failed to spoil it. But there is no impropriety
in saying of Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span>, that he so delighted in
the labour in hand as to make it seem, to those who worked
with him, that he looked upon it in the light of a pleasant
recreation rather than in the light of a dry task.</p>

<p class='c010'>But whatever the ultimate differences of opinion,
amongst those concerned in such a matter, about the merits
of the Museum Catalogue, begun in 1839, there was no
difference at all, either in the House or out of it, as to the
conspicuous merits of his performance of every subsequent
duty. His stores of knowledge were put, with the utmost
readiness, at the service of all sorts of readers; and he was
not less admirable in the discharge of his office of Superintendent
of the Reading-Room than afterwards in the
more prominent office of Keeper of Printed Books—which
he held little more than three years.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis</span> retired, in 1856, from the office
of Principal-Librarian, the Collection of Printed Books—which
he had found, on his accession to that office, extending
to less than one hundred and fifty thousand volumes—exceeded
five hundred and twenty thousand volumes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>The annual number of Readers admitted had increased
from about seven hundred and fifty to nearly four
thousand.</p>

<p class='c011'>The one step which did more than aught else to promote
this improvement was the systematic survey of the then
existing condition of the Printed Library, in all the great
departments of knowledge, which Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> set on foot
in 1843, and embodied in a Memoir addressed to the
Trustees, on the first of January, 1845.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Mr. Panizzi’s Memoir on the Collection of Printed Books, 1845.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The principle on which this Memoir was compiled lay in
the careful comparison of the Museum Catalogues with the
best special bibliographies, and with the Catalogues of
other Libraries. In Jurisprudence, for example, the national
collection was tested by the <cite>Bibliotheca Juridica</cite> of
<span class='sc'>Lipenius</span>, <span class='sc'>Senckenberg</span>, and <span class='sc'>Madahn</span>; by the list of law-books
inserted in <span class='sc'>Dupin’s</span> edition of <span class='sc'>Camus’</span> <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres sur
la profession d’Avocat</span></cite>, and by the <cite>Bibliothèque diplomatique
choisie</cite> of <span class='sc'>Martens</span>. In Political Economy, by <span class='sc'>Blanqui’s</span>
list given in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de l’Economie politique en Europe</span></cite>.
The Mathematical section of the Library was compared
with <span class='sc'>Rogg’s</span> <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Handbuch der mathematischen Literatur</span></cite>. In
British History, the <cite>Bibliotheca Grenvilliana</cite>, and the
<cite>Catalogue of the Library of the Writers to the Signet</cite>, were
examined, for those sections of the subject to which they
were more particularly applicable, and so on in the
other departments. The facts thus elicited were striking.
It was shown that much had been done since 1836 to
augment almost every section of the Library; but that the
deficiencies were still of the most conspicuous sort. In a
word, the statement abundantly established the truth of
the proposition that ‘the Collection of Printed Books in the
British Museum is not nearly so complete and perfect as
the National Library of Great Britain ought to be&#160;...’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_571'>571</span>and it then proceeded to discuss the further question: ‘By
what means can the collection be brought with all proper
despatch to a state of as much completeness and perfection
as is attainable in such matters, and as the public service
may require?’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was shown that no reliance could be placed upon
donations, for the filling up those gaps in the Library which
were the special subject of the Memoir. Rare and precious
books might thus come, but not the widely miscellaneous
assemblage still needed. As to special grants for
the acquisition of entire collections, not one of ten such
collections, it was thought, would, under existing circumstances,
be suitable for the Museum. The Copyright-tax
has no bearing, however rigidly enforced, save on current
British Literature. There remained, therefore, but one
adequate resource, that of annual Parliamentary grants,
unfettered by restrictions as to their application, and capable
of being depended upon for a considerable number of years
to come. Purchases might thus be organized in all parts of
the world with foresight, system, and continuity. In the
letter addressed by the Trustees to the Treasury, it was
stated that, ‘for filling up the chasms which are so much to
be regretted, and some of which are distinctly set forth in
the annexed document, the Trustees think that a sum of
not less than ten thousand a year will be required for the
next ten years,’ in addition to the usual five thousand a
year for the ordinary acquisitions of the Library.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Lords of the Treasury were not willing to recommend
to Parliament a larger annual grant than ten thousand
pounds, ‘for the purchase of books of all descriptions,’
but so far they were disposed to proceed,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Treasury
Minutes</cite>,
1845.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘for some
years to come;’ and they strongly inculcated upon the
Trustees ‘the necessity, during the continuance of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>grants, of postponing additions to the other collections
under their charge, which, however desirable in themselves,
are of subordinate importance to that of completing the
Library.’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Manuscripts
added in
the years
1849, 1850.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>In 1843, an important series of modern Historical MSS.,
relating more especially to the South of Europe, was purchased
from the <span class='sc'>Ranuzzi</span> family of Bologna. The papers
of the Brothers Laurence <span class='sc'>Hyde</span>, Earl of Rochester, and
Henry <span class='sc'>Hyde</span>, Earl of Clarendon, were also secured. Additions,
too, of considerable interest, were made to the theological
and classical sections of the MS. Department, by
the purchase of many vellum MSS., ranging from the
eleventh to the fifteenth centuries. In 1849, the most
important acquisitions related to our British History.
About three hundred documents illustrative of the English
Wars in France (1418 to 1450), nearly a hundred autograph
letters of <span class='sc'>William III</span>, and an extensive series of transcripts
from the archives at the Hague, were thus gathered for the
future historian. In 1850, a curious series of Stammbücker,
three hundred and twenty in number, and in date
extending from 1554 to 1785, was obtained by purchase.
These Albums, collectively, contained more than twenty-seven
thousand autographs of persons more or less eminent
in the various departments of human activity. Amongst
them is the signature of <span class='sc'>Milton</span>. The acquisitions of 1851
included some Biblical MSS. of great curiosity; an extensive
series of autograph letters (chiefly from the Donnadieu
Collection), and a large number of papers relating to the
affairs of the English Mint.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the year last-named Sir Frederick <span class='sc'>Madden</span> thus
summed up the accessions to his Department since the
year 1836:</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Tabular view of the accessions to the MSS. Department from 1836–1851.</span></div>

<p class='c014'>And he adds:—‘If money had been forthcoming, the number
of manuscripts acquired during the last fifteen years might
have been more than doubled. The collections that have
passed into other hands, namely, Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Chambers’</span>
Sanscrit MSS.; Sir William <span class='sc'>Ouseley’s</span> Persian; <span class='sc'>Bruce’s</span>
Ethiopic and Arabic; <span class='sc'>Michael’s</span> Hebrew; <span class='sc'>Libri’s</span> Italian,
French, Latin, and Miscellaneous; <span class='sc'>Barrois’</span> French and
Latin; as well as the Stowe Collection of Anglo-Saxon,
Irish, and English manuscripts, might all have been so
united. The liberality of the Treasury becomes very small
when compared with the expenditure of individuals. Lord
<span class='sc'>Ashburnham</span>, during the last ten years, has paid nearly as
large a sum for MSS. as has been expended on the National
Collection since the Museum was first founded.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Growth of the Printed Department up to 1851.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The causes which at this period again tended somewhat to
slacken the growth of the Printed Collection have been
glanced at already. But during the fifteen years from
1836 to 1851, it had increased at the rate of sixteen
thousand volumes a year, on the average. When the estimates
of 1852 were under discussion, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> stated,
‘that till room is provided, the deficiency must in a great
measure continue, and new [foreign] books only to a
limited extent be purchased.’ The grant for such purchases
was therefore, in that year, limited to four thousand
pounds. In a subsequent report, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> added,
‘that he could not but deeply regret the ill-consequences
which must accrue by allowing old deficiencies to continue,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>and new ones to accumulate.’ From the same
report may be gathered a precise view of the actual additions,
from all sources, during the quinquennium of 1846–1850.
The increase in the printed books, therefore,
although it had not quite kept pace with Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span>
hopeful anticipations in 1852, had actually reached a larger
yearly average, during that last quinquennium, than was
attained in the like period from 1846 to 1850.</p>

<p class='c011'>The report from which these figures are taken was made
in furtherance of the good and fruitful suggestion that a
great Reading-Room should be built within the inner
quadrangle. Judging from the past, argued Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>,
in June, 1852, ‘and supposing that for the next ten years
from seven thousand to seven thousand five hundred pounds
will be spent in the purchase of printed books, the increase&#160;... would be at the average of about twenty-seven
thousand volumes a year, without taking into consideration
the chance of an extraordinary increase, owing to the purchase
or donation of any large collection.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See hereafter,
Chap. V.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It was owing
to the splendid bequest of Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> that the additions
to the Collection in 1847 reached the enormous amount
of more than fifty-five thousand volumes. After the steady
and regular addition of about twenty-seven thousand
volumes for ten years together, here reckoned upon, the
Collection of Printed Books in the British Museum might
defy comparison, and would approach, as near as seems
practicable in such matters, to a state of completeness.
The increase for the ten years next following might be
fairly reduced to two thirds of the above sum.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Growth of
the Printed
Section of
the Library
since 1852.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
At this
rate, the collection of books, which has been more than
doubled during the last fifteen years, would be double
of what it now is in twenty years from the present time
[1852].’ At the date of this report the number of volumes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>was already upwards of four hundred and seventy thousand.
At the date at which I now write (January, 1870), the
number of volumes, as nearly as it can be calculated,
has become one million and six thousand. On the average,
therefore, of the whole period, the increase has been not
less than thirty-one thousand five hundred volumes in every
year. The Collection was somewhat more than doubled
during the first fifteen years of Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> Keepership.
During the next like term of years, when the department
was partly under the administration of Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, and
partly under that of Mr. Winter <span class='sc'>Jones</span>, it was nearly
doubled again. It follows that the anticipation expressed
in the <cite>Report</cite> of 1852 has been much more than fulfilled.
Less than seventeen years of labour have achieved what
was then expected to be the work of twenty years.</p>

<p class='c010'>If the other departments of the British Museum cannot
show an equal ratio of growth during the term now under
review, it has not been from lack of zeal, either in their
heads or in the Trustees. Their progress, too, was very
great, although it is not capable of being so strikingly and
compendiously illustrated. It has also to be borne in mind
that the arrears, so to speak, of the Library, were relatively
greater than those of some other divisions of the Museum.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Progress of the Natural History Collections.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>At the commencement of Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Ellis’s</span> term of
Principal-Librarianship, the Natural-History Collections were
partly under the charge of Dr. <span class='sc'>Leach</span>, partly under that
of Mr. Charles <span class='sc'>König</span>. Both were officers of considerable
scientific attainments. In the instance of Dr. <span class='sc'>Leach</span>, certain
peculiar eccentricities and crotchets were mixed up in
close union with undoubted learning and skill. In not a
few eminent naturalists a tendency to undervalue the
achievements of past days, and to exaggerate those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>the day that is passing, has often been noted. <span class='sc'>Leach</span>
evinced this tendency in more ways than one. But a
favourite way of manifesting it led him many times into
difficulties with his neighbours. He despised the taxidermy
of Sir Hans <span class='sc'>Sloane’s</span> age, and made periodical bonfires of
Sloanian specimens. These he was wont to call his
‘cremations.’ In his time, the Gardens of the Museum
were still a favourite resort of the Bloomsburians, but the
attraction of the terraces and the fragrance of the shrubberies
were sadly lessened when a pungent odour of
burning snakes was their accompaniment. The stronger
the complaints, however, the more apparent became Dr.
<span class='sc'>Leach’s</span> attachment to his favourite cremations.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>George Montagu; his labours in Natural History and his Zoological Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Leach</span> was the friend and correspondent of that eminent
cultivator of the classificatory sciences, Colonel George
<span class='sc'>Montagu</span>, of Lackham. Both of them rank among the
early members of the Linnæan Society, and it was under
<span class='sc'>Leach’s</span> editorship that <span class='sc'>Montagu’s</span> latest contributions to
the Society’s <cite>Transactions</cite> were published.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1802–13.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Montagu’s</span>
<cite>Synopsis of British Birds</cite> marks an epoch in the annals of
our local ornithology, as does his treatise entitled <cite>Testacea
Britannica</cite> in those of conchology.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1803–9.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His contributions to
the National Collections were very liberal. But he did not
care much for any books save those that treated of natural
history. In addition to a good estate and a fine mansion,
he had inherited from his brother a choice old Library at
Lackham, and a large cabinet of coins. These, I believe,
he turned to account as means of barter for books and specimens
in his favourite department of study. His love of
the beauties of nature led him to prefer an unpretending
abode in Devon to his fine Wiltshire house, and it was at
Knowle that he died in August, 1815. His Collections in
Zoology were purchased by the Trustees, and were removed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>from Knowle soon after his death. Scarcely any other
purchase of like value in the Natural-History Department was
made for more than twenty years afterwards. After the
purchase of the Montagu Collection, the growth of that
department depended, as it had mainly depended before it,
on the acquisitions made for the Public by the several
naturalists who took part in the Voyages of Discovery or
whose chance collections, made in the course of ordinary
duty, came to be at the disposal of the British Admiralty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Many of those naturalists were men of marked ability.
Of necessity, their explorations were attended with much
curious adventure. To detail their researches and vicissitudes
would form—without much credit to the writer—an
interesting chapter, the materials of which are superabundant.
But, at present, it must needs be matter of hope,
not of performance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The distinctive progress of the Natural-History Collections,
from comparative and relative poverty, to a creditable
place amongst rival collections, connects itself pre-eminently
with the labours of Dr. John Edward <span class='sc'>Gray</span>, who
will hereafter be remembered as the ablest keeper and
organizer those collections have hitherto had. Dr. <span class='sc'>Gray</span> is
now (1870) in the forty-sixth year of his public service at
the British Museum, which he entered as an Assistant, in
1824. He is widely known by his able edition of <span class='sc'>Griffiths’</span>
<cite>Animal Kingdom</cite>, by his <cite>Illustrations of Indian Zoology</cite>, by
his account of the famous Derby Menagerie at Knowsley,
and by his <cite>Manual of British Shells</cite>; but his least ostensible
publications rank among the most conclusive proofs both of
his ability and of his zeal for the public service. Dr. <span class='sc'>Gray</span>
has always advocated the publication—to use Mr. <span class='sc'>Carlyle’s</span>
words when under interrogatory by the Museum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>Commissioners of 1848—of ‘all sorts of Catalogues.’ It
is to him that the Public owe the admirable helps to the
study of natural history which have been afforded by the
long series of inventories, guides, and nomenclators, the
publication of which began, at his instance, in the year
1844, and has been unceasingly pursued. A mere list of
the various printed synopses which have grown out of
Dr. <span class='sc'>Gray’s</span> suggestion of 1844 would fill many such pages
as that which the reader has now before him. The consequence
is, that in no department of the Museum can the
student, as yet, economise his time as he can economise it
in the Natural-History Department. <em>Printed</em>, not Manuscript,
Catalogues mean time saved; disappointment
avoided; study fructified. No literary labour brings so
little of credit as does the work of the Catalogue-maker.
None better deserves the gratitude of scholars, as well as of
the general mass of visitors.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>State of the Natural History Collections of the Museum in 1836.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Gray</span> became Keeper of Zoology in 1840. Four years
earlier, he had given to Sir Benjamin <span class='sc'>Hawes’</span> Committee a
striking account of the condition of that department, illustrating
it by comparisons with the corresponding Collections
in Paris, which may thus (not without unavoidable injustice)
be abridged:—The species of mammalia then in the Museum
were four hundred and five; the species of birds were two
thousand four hundred, illustrated by four thousand six hundred
and fifty-nine individual specimens. At that date, the
latest accessible data assigned to the Paris Collection about
five hundred species of mammals, and about two thousand
three hundred species of birds, illustrated by nearly six
thousand specimens. The Museum series of birds was
almost equally rich in the orders, taken generally; but in
gallinaceous birds it was more than proportionately rich, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>large number of splendid examples having been received
from India. In the birds of Africa, of Brazil, and of
Northern Europe, also, the Museum was already exceptionally
well-stored.</p>

<p class='c011'>The special value of the Ornithological Collection undoubtedly
showed that it had been more elaborately cared for
than had been some other parts of natural history. But the
extent and richness of the bird gallery, even at this period,
is not to be ascribed merely to a desire to delight the eyes
of a crowd of visitors. For scientific purposes, a collection
of birds must be more largely-planned and better filled than
a collection of mammals, or one of fish. In birds, the
essential characters of a considerable group of individual
specimens may be identical and their colours entirely
different.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See <cite>Minutes of Evidence</cite>, 1836, p. 238.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Besides the numerous diversities attendant upon
age and sex, the very date at which a bird is killed may
produce variations which have their interest for the scientific
student.</p>

<p class='c011'>The number of species of reptiles was in 1836 about
six hundred, illustrated by about one thousand three hundred
specimens. This number was much inferior to that
of the Museum at Paris, but it exceeded by one third the
number of species in the Vienna Museum,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><em>Ibid.</em>, p. 242
(Q. 2996–9).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
and almost by
one half the then number at Berlin.</p>

<p class='c011'>The species of fish amounted to nearly a thousand, but
this was hardly the fourth of the great collection at Paris,
although it probably exceeded every other, or almost every
other, Continental collection of the same date. Of shells,
the Museum number of species was four thousand and
twenty-five (exclusive of fossils), illustrated by about fifteen
thousand individuals. This number of species was at par
with that of Paris; much superior both to Berlin and to
Leyden; but it was far from representing positive—as distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>from comparative—wealth. There were already,
in 1836, more than nine thousand known species of shells.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was further shown in the evidence that, even under the
arrangements of 1836, the facilities of public access equalled
those given at the most liberal of the Continental Museums,
and considerably exceeded those which obtained at fully
four-fifths of their number.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among the many services rendered to the Museum by
Dr. <span class='sc'>Gray</span>, one is of too important a character to be passed
over, even in a notice so brief as this must needs be.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The
Hardwicke
Bequest of
Zoology.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The
large bequest in Zoology of Major-General <span class='sc'>Hardwicke</span>
grew out of a stipulation made by Dr. <span class='sc'>Gray</span>, when he
undertook, at General <span class='sc'>Hardwicke’s</span> request, the editorship
of the <cite>Illustrations of Indian Zoology</cite>. A long labour
brought to the editor no pecuniary return, but it brought
an important collection to the British Public in the first
instance, and eventually a large augmentation of what had
been originally given.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Growth of the Natural History Collections of the Museum. 1836–49.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In March, 1849, the course of inquiries pursued by
Lord <span class='sc'>Ellesmere’s</span> Commission led to a new review of the
growth of the Natural-History Collections, and more especially
of the Zoology. It applied in particular to the twelve
or thirteen years which had then elapsed since the prior
inquiries of 1835–1836. The statement possesses much
interest, but it is occasionally deficient in that systematic
and necessary distinction between species and specimens
which characterised the evidence of 1836. In brief, however,
it may be said, that in the eight years extending
between June, 1840, and June, 1848, twenty-nine thousand
five hundred and ninety-five <em>specimens</em> of vertebrated
animals were added to the Museum galleries and storehouses.
Of these, five thousand seven hundred and ninety-seven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>were mammals; thirteen thousand four hundred and
fourteen were birds; four thousand one hundred and twelve
reptiles; and six thousand two hundred and seventy-two
were fish. The number of specimens of annulose animals
added during the same period was seventy-three thousand
five hundred and sixty-three: and that of mollusca and

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Check in the growth of Natural-History Collections on the Continent, 1845–1855.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, on the Continent of Europe, political commotion
had seriously checked the due progress of scientific
collections. Britain had been making unwonted strides in
the improvement of its Museum, at the very time when
most of the Continental States had allowed their fine
Museums to remain almost stationary. In mammals,
birds, and shells, the British Museum had placed itself in
the first rank. Only in reptiles, fish, and crustacea, could
even Paris now claim superiority. Those classes had there
engaged for a long series of years the unremitting research
and labour of such naturalists as <span class='sc'>Cuvier</span>, <span class='sc'>Dumeril</span>,
<span class='sc'>Valenciennes</span>, and <span class='sc'>Milne-Edwards</span>; and their relative
wealth of specimens it will be hard to overtake. In insects,
the Museum Collection vies with that of Paris in point of
extent, and excels it in point of arrangement.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>Not less conspicuous had been the growth of the several
Departments of Antiquities. And this part of the story of
the Museum teems with varied interest. Within a period
of less than thirty years, vast and widely-distant cities, rich
in works of art, have been literally disinterred. In succession
to the superb marbles of Athens, of Phigaleia, and of
Rome, some of the choicest sculptures and most curious
minor antiquities of Nineveh, of Calah, of Erech, of Ur-of-the-Chaldees,
of Babylon, of Xanthus, of Halicarnassus,
of Cnidus, and of Carthage, have come to London.</p>

<p class='c011'>The growth of the subordinate Collections of Archæology
has been scarcely less remarkable. The series of ancient
vases—to take but one example—of which the research
and liberality of Sir William <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> laid a good
foundation almost a century ago, has come at length to
surpass its wealthiest compeers. Only a few years earlier,
it ranked as but the third, perhaps as but the fourth,
among the great vase collections of Europe. London, in
that point of view, was below both Naples and Paris, if not
also below Munich. It now ranks above them all; possessing
two thousand six hundred vases, as against two
thousand at Paris, and two thousand one hundred at
Naples.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c013'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Another department, lying in part nearer home—that of
British, Mediæval, and Ethnological Antiquities—has been
almost created by the labours of the last twenty years. The
‘British’ Museum can no longer be said to be a misnomer,
as designating an establishment in which British Archæology
met with no elucidation.</p>

History.—The House of Commons’ Committee of 1860:—Further
Reorganization of the Departments—Summary
of the Growth of the Collections in the years
1856–1866, and of their increased Use and Enjoyment
by the Public.</em></p>

<p class='c010'>No question connected with the improvement of the
British Museum has, from time to time, more largely engrossed
the attention, either of Parliament or of the Public
at large, than has the question of the Buildings. On none
<span class='pageno' id='Page_584'>584</span>have the divergences of opinion been greater, or the expressions
of dissatisfaction with the plans—or with the
want of plan—louder or more general.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet there is no doubt (amongst those, at least, who have
had occasion to examine the subject closely) that the architects
of the new British Museum—first Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Smirke</span>,
and then Mr. Sydney <span class='sc'>Smirke</span>—have been conspicuous for
professional ability. Nor is there any doubt, anywhere,
that the Trustees of the Museum have bestowed diligent
attention on the plans submitted to them. They have
been most anxious to discharge that part of their duty to
the Public with the same faithfulness which, on the whole,
has characterised their general fulfilment of the trust committed
to them. Why, it is natural to ask, has their success
been so unequal?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Causes of the unsatisfactoriness of many parts of the new Museum Buildings.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Without presuming upon the possession of competence
to answer the question with fulness, there is no undue confidence
in offering a partial reply. Part of their failure to
satisfy the public expectations has arisen from a laches in
Parliament itself. At the critical time when the character
of the new buildings had practically to be decided, parsimoniousness
led, not only to construction piecemeal, but to
the piecemeal preparation of the designs themselves. Temporary
makeshifts took the place of foreseeing plans. And
what may have sounded like economy in 1830 has, in its
necessary results, proved to be very much like waste, long
before 1870.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had a comprehensive scheme of reconstruction been
looked fully in the face when, forty years ago, the new
buildings began to be erected, three fourths at most of
the money which has been actually expended would have
sufficed for the erection of a Museum, far more satisfactory
in its architectural character, and affording at least one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>fourth more of accommodation for the National Collections.
The British Museum buildings have afforded a salient instance
of the truth of <span class='sc'>Burke’s</span> words: ‘Great expense may
be an essential part in true economy. Mere parsimony is
<em>not</em> economy.’ But, in this instance, the fault is plainly in
Parliament, not in the Trustees of the establishment which
has suffered.</p>

<p class='c011'>The one happy exception to the general unsatisfactoriness
of the new buildings—as regards, not merely architectural
beauty, but fitness of plan, sufficiency of light, and
adaptedness to purpose—is seen in the new Reading-Room.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The new
Reading-Room.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And the new Reading-Room is, virtually, the production of
an amateur architect. The chief merits of its design belong,
indubitably, to Sir Antonio <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>. The story of
that part of the new building is worth the telling.</p>

<p class='c011'>That some good result should be eventually derived
from the large space of ground within the inner quadrangle
had been many times suggested. The suggestion offered,
in 1837, by Mr. Thomas <span class='sc'>Watts</span> was thus expressed in his
letter to the Editor of the <cite>Mechanics Magazine</cite>:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The suggestions for building additional Libraries of 1837 and of 1847.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span> began by criticising, somewhat incisively,
the architectural skill which had constructed a vast quadrangle
without providing it even with the means of a free
circulation of air. He pinned Sir Robert <span class='sc'>Smirke</span> on the
horns of a dilemma. If, he argued, the architect looked to
a sanitary result, he had, in fact, provided a well of malaria.
If he contemplated a display of art, he had, by consenting
to the abolition of his northern portico, spoiled and
destroyed all architectural effect. ‘The space,’ he proceeded
to say, which has thus been wasted, ‘would have
afforded accommodation <em>for the whole Library</em>, much superior
to what is now proposed to afford it. A Reading-Room
of ample dimensions might have stood in the centre, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>been surrounded, on all four sides, with galleries for the
books.’ Afterwards, when adverting to the great expense
which had been incurred upon the façades of the quadrangle,
he went on to say: ‘It might now seem barbarous to propose
the filling up of the square—as ought originally to
have been done.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Mechanics’
Magazine</cite>
(1837); vol.
xxvi, pp. 295,
seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Perhaps the best plan would be to
design another range of building entirely [new?], enclosing
the present building on the eastern and northern sides as
the Elgin and other galleries do on the western. To do
this, it would be necessary to purchase and pull down
one side of two streets,—Montagu Street and Montagu
Place.’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><em>Ibid.</em><span class='hidev'>|</span></span></p>

<div class='sidenote'>See Chap. ii of Book III, p. 566, and the accompanying fac-simile.</div>

<p class='c011'>As I have intimated already, this alternative project was
unconsciously reproduced, by the present writer, ten years
later, without any idea that it had been anticipated. But
neither to the mind of the writer of 1837, nor to that of
the writer of 1847, did the grand feature of construction
which, within another decade, has given to London a
splendid building as well as a most admirable Reading-Room,
present itself. The substantial merit, both of originally
suggesting, and of (in the main) eventually realising
the actual building of 1857, belongs to Antonio <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>As to the claims on that score advanced by Mr. <span class='sc'>Hosking</span>,
formerly Professor of Architecture at King’s College, they
apply to a plan wholly different from the plan which was
carried into execution.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Hosking’s</span> scheme was drawn up, for private circulation,
in February, 1848 (thirteen months after the writing
of my own pamphlet entitled <cite>Public Libraries in London
and in Paris</cite>, and more than six months after its circulation
in print), when it was first submitted to Lord <span class='sc'>Ellesmere’s</span>
Commission of Inquiry. It was first published (in
<cite>The Builder</cite>) in June, 1850. His object was to provide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>a grand central hall for the Department of Antiquities.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Mr. <span class='sc'>Hosking</span> called public attention to his design
of 1848—in a pamphlet entitled <cite>Some Remarks upon the
recent Addition of a Reading-Room to the British Museum</cite>—Mr.
Sydney <span class='sc'>Smirke</span> wrote to him thus:—‘I recollect
seeing your plans at a meeting of the Trustees,&#160;... shortly
after you sent them [to Lord <span class='sc'>Ellesmere</span>]. When, long
subsequently, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> showed me his sketch for a plan
of a new Reading-Room, I confess it did not remind me of
yours, the purposes of the two plans and the treatment and
construction were so different.’<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c013'><sup>[33]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Sydney

&amp;c.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Whilst to Mr. <span class='sc'>Smirke</span>
himself belongs the merit of practical execution, that of
design belongs no less unquestionably to <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> himself preferred, at first, the plan of
extending the building on the eastern and northern sides.
His suggestions had the approval of the Commissioners of
1850.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The new
or Panizzi
Reading-Room.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But the Government was slow to give power to
the Trustees to carry out the plan of their officer and the
recommendation of the Commissioners of Inquiry, by proposing
the needful vote in a Committee of Supply. Plan
and Report alike lay dormant from the year 1850 to 1854. It
was then that, as a last resort, and as a measure of economy,
by avoiding all present necessity to buy more ground of the
Duke of <span class='sc'>Bedford</span>, Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> recommended the Trustees
to build within the quadrangle, and drew a sketch-plan, on
which their architect reported favourably. Sixty-one thousand
pounds, by way of a first instalment, was voted on the
third of July, 1854. The present noble structure was
completed within three years from that day, and its total
cost—including the extensive series of book-galleries and
rooms of various kinds, subserving almost innumerable
purposes—amounted in round numbers to a hundred and
fifty thousand pounds. It was thus only a little more than
the cost of the King’s Library, which accommodates eighty
thousand volumes of books and a Collection of Birds. The
new Reading-Room and its appendages can be made to
accommodate, in addition to its three hundred and more of
readers, some million, or near it, of volumes, without impediment
to their fullest accessibility.</p>

<p class='c011'>To describe by words a room which, in 1870, has become
more or less familiar, I suppose, to hundreds of
thousands of Britons, and to a good many thousands of
foreigners, would now be superfluous. But it will not be
without advantage, perhaps, to show its character and appearance
with the simple brevity of woodcuts.</p>

<p class='c011'>The following illustrative block-plan shows the general
<span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>arrangement of the Museum building at large, at the date

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>Of course, the improvements thus effected did but solve
a portion of the difficulty felt, long before 1857, in accommodating
the National Collections upon any adequate scale,
which should provide alike for present claims and for
future extension. This more effectual provision became
one of the most pressing questions with which both the
Trustees and their officers had now to deal. During the
whole term of Sir A. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> Principal-Librarianship
this building question increased in gravity and urgency,
from year to year. Both the Trustees and the Principal-Librarian
were intent upon its solution. But the latter
was enforced, by failing health, to quit office, leaving the
matter still unsolved.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Parliamentary inquiry into proposed enlargement of British Museum in 1860.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Most of the little information on this part of the subject
which, within my present limits, it will be practicable for
me to offer to the reader, belongs, properly, to a subsequent
chapter. But some brief notice must be given here of the
important inquiries, ‘how far, and in what way, it may be
desirable to find increased space for the extension and
arrangement of the various Collections of the British
Museum, and the best means of rendering them available
for the promotion of Science and Art,’ which were made,
between the months of May and August of 1860, by a
Select Committee of the House of Commons.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first question to be answered by the Committee of
1860 was this: Is it expedient, or not, that the <em>Natural-History</em>
Collections should be removed from Bloomsbury, to
make room for the inevitable growth of the Collections of
<em>Antiquities</em>?</p>

<p class='c011'>After an elaborate inquiry, spreading over three months,
the Committee reported thus:—‘The witnesses examined
have, almost unanimously, testified to the preference
over the other Collections, with which the Natural-History
<span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>Collections are viewed by the ordinary and most
numerous frequenters of the Museum. This preference is
easily accounted for; the objects exhibited, especially the
birds, from the beauty of their plumage, are calculated to
attract and amuse the spectators.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The
Select
Committee
of the
House of
Commons,
1860.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The eye has been accustomed
in many instances to the living specimens in the
Zoological Gardens, and cheap publications and prints have
rendered their forms more or less familiar. It is, indeed,
easily intelligible that, while for the full appreciation of
works of archæological interest and artistic excellence a
special education must be necessary, the works of Nature
may be studied with interest and instruction by all persons
of ordinary intelligence. It appears, from evidence, that
many of the middle classes are in the habit of forming collections
in various branches of Natural History, and that
many, even the working classes, employ their holidays in
the study of botany or geology, or in the collection of insects
obtained in the neighbourhood of London; that they
refer to the British Museum, in order to ascertain the
proper classification of the specimens thus obtained, and
that want of leisure alone restrains the further increase of
this class of visitors. Your Committee, in order to confirm
their view of the peculiar popularity of the Natural-History
Collections, beg to refer to a return from the Principal-Librarian,
which shows the number of visitors in the
several public portions of the Museum, at the same hour of
the day, during fifteen open days, from the fifteenth of June
to the eleventh of July, 1860. From this it appears that
two thousand five hundred and fifty-seven persons were in
the Galleries of Antiquities at the given hour, and one thousand
and fifty-six in the King’s Library and MSS. Rooms,
while three thousand three hundred and seventy-eight were
in the Natural-History Galleries; showing an excess of two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>hundred and twenty per cent. in the Natural-History
Department over the King’s Library and MSS. Rooms,
and of thirty-three per cent. over the Galleries of Antiquities,
notwithstanding that the latter are of considerably
greater extent than the Galleries of Natural History. The
evidence received by your Committee induces the belief
that the removal of these most popular collections from
their present central position to one less generally accessible
would excite much dissatisfaction, not merely among a
large portion of the inhabitants of the metropolis, but
among the numerous inhabitants of the country, who
from time to time visit London by railway, and to whom
the proximity of the British Museum to most of the railway
termini, as compared with the distance of the localities
to which it has been proposed to transport such collections,
is of great practical importance. Similar evidence shows
that the proposed removal of those collections from the
British Museum has excited grave and general disapprobation
in the scientific world. Your Committee cannot here
employ more forcible language than that made use of in a
memorial signed by one hundred and fourteen persons, including
many eminent promoters and cultivators of science
in England, and presented to the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in 1848. The following are their words:—“We
beg to add the expression of our opinion that the removal
of the Natural-History Collections from the site where they
have been established for upwards of a century, in the
centre of London, particularly if to any situation distant
from that centre, would be viewed by the mass of the inhabitants
with extreme disfavour, it being a well-known fact
that by far the greater number of visitors to the Museum
consists of those who frequent the halls containing the
Natural-History Collections, while it is obvious that many of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>those persons who come from the densely peopled districts of
the eastern, northern, and southern parts of London, would
feel it very inconvenient to resort to any distant locality.”’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Recommendations of the Commons’ Committee of 1860.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>After an elaborate examination into the nature and
extent of those enlargements which the present growth and
probable increase of the several Collections of Antiquities
and of Natural History render necessary, the Committee
proceed thus:—</p>

<p class='c011'>The ground immediately surrounding the Museum, says
the reporter, speaking of the adjacent streets to the east,
west, and north, ‘comprises altogether about five and a half
acres, valued by Mr. <span class='sc'>Smirke</span> at about two hundred and
forty thousand pounds. As the proprietary interest in all
this ground belongs to a single owner, your Committee are
of opinion that it would be convenient, and possibly even a
profitable arrangement, for the State at once to purchase
that interest, and to receive the rents of the lessees in
return for the capital invested. The State would then have
the power, whenever any further extension of the Museum
became necessary, to obtain possession of such houses as
might best suit the purpose in view.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Independently, however, of this larger suggestion, your
Committee are fully convinced, both from the uniform
purport of the papers printed at different times by the
House of Commons, and from the statements of the various
witnesses whom they have now examined, that it is indispensable,
not merely to the appropriate exhibition of our
unequalled National Collections, but even to the avoidance
of greater ultimate expense, through alterations and re-arrangements,
that sufficient space should be immediately
acquired in connexion with the British Museum, to meet
the requirements of the several departments which have
been enumerated under the last head, and that such space
<span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>should throughout be adapted, by its position, extent, and
facilities of application, to the arrangement of the collections
on a comprehensive, and, therefore, probably permanent
system. They will now proceed to point out several
sites, either on or adjoining the present ground of the
Museum, which seem to them to present the greatest advantages
for the accommodation of the respective departments.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Natural History Collections.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Although, the Committee proceed to say, the amount of
space which, on the foregoing estimate, would be requisite for
the Natural-History Collections is not so great as to involve
the necessity of their removal from the British Museum on
that ground alone, your Committee, nevertheless, attach so
much weight to the arguments in favour of preserving the
various departments of the Museum from the risk of collision
with each other, that, should it be determined to provide
new space for Natural History in connexion with the
Museum, they would make it a primary object to isolate
its collections, as far as possible, from all others in the
same locality. The chief part of the Natural-History Collections
is now on the upper floor, where they occupy, according
to the return of Mr. <span class='sc'>Smirke</span>, in November, 1857,
forty-eight thousand four hundred and forty-two superficial
feet. The remainder of that floor, containing, exclusively of
a small space not reckoned by Mr. <span class='sc'>Smirke</span>, twenty-one
thousand five hundred and thirty-two feet, is occupied by
Antiquities. It appears to your Committee that if, by any
adaptation of ground to be acquired adjoining the Museum,
adequate space should be provided elsewhere for the Antiquities
now on the upper floor, the most expedient arrangement
would be to appropriate the whole of that floor to
the Natural-History Collections. If this space proved insufficient
for all such collections, your Committee would then
recommend that the newly acquired portion should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>applied exclusively to the Department of Zoology; and that
a sufficient portion of ground should be purchased on the
north side of the Museum as a site for galleries to provide
for Mineralogy, and thus also indirectly for Geology.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Prints and Drawings.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>A convenient site for this department would, in the
opinion of the Committee, be provided by the suggested
acquisition of additional ground on the north side. A
building might there be erected in continuation of the
present east wing of the Museum, to contain, on its upper
floor, the Mineralogical Collections, and on the lower the
Prints and Drawings, with adequate space both for their
preservation and exhibition.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Antiquities.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In determining the site most suitable for the large additional
accommodation required for this department, the
Committee thought it most prudent that the Trustees of the
Museum should be guided, partly by the greater or less cost
of purchasing the requisite amount of ground in different
directions, but chiefly by the greater or less fitness of the different
portions of ground for the best system of arrangement.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Internal economy:—Reorganization and subdivision of Departments. 1856–66.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In the same year in which Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> became Principal-Librarian
(1856), one of the recommendations of Lord
<span class='sc'>Ellesmere’s</span> Commission-Report of 1850 was carried
into effect by the creation of the new office of ‘Superintendent
of the Natural-History Departments.’ And the
former partial subdivision and reorganization of those
departments was, in the following year, carried further by
the formation of a separate Department of Mineralogy. In
subsequent years, the old Department of Antiquities was, like
the Natural History, divided into four departments, namely,
(1) Greek and Roman Antiquities; (2) Oriental Antiquities;
(3) British and Mediæval Antiquities and Ethnography;
(4) Coins and Medals.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>At present (1870), it may here be added, the entire
Museum is divided into twelve departments, comprising
three several groups of four sections to each. The Natural-History
group being comprised of (1) Zoology; (2) Palæontology;
(3) Botany; (4) Mineralogy. The Literary group
comprising (1) Printed Books; (2) Manuscripts; (3)
Prints and Drawings; (4) Maps, Charts, Plans, and Topographical
Drawings. Experience has amply vindicated
the wisdom of the principle of subdivision. But it is
probable that the principle has now been carried as far as
it can usefully work in practice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Increased efficiency and rapidly growing collections
brought with them enlarged grants from Parliament. In
the first year of Sir A. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> Principal-Librarianship,
the estimate put before the House of Commons for the
service of the year 1856–7 was sixty thousand pounds, as
compared with a grant for the service of the year immediately
preceding of fifty-six thousand one hundred and
eighty pounds. In his last year of office, the estimate for
the service of the year 1866–67 amounted to one hundred
and two thousand seven hundred and forty-four pounds,
against a grant in the year preceding of ninety-eight thousand
one hundred and sixty-four pounds.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Statistics of Public Access.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>There had also been, in that decade, a marked degree of
increase—though one of much fluctuation—in the number
of visits, both to the General Collections and, much more
notably, to the Reading-Rooms and the Galleries for Study.
In 1856, the number of general visitors was three hundred
and sixty-one thousand seven hundred and fourteen; in
1866, it was four hundred and eight thousand two hundred
and seventy-nine. But in the ‘Exhibition Year’ (1862),
it had reached eight hundred and ninety-five thousand and
seventy-seven, which was itself little more than one third
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>of the exceptionally enormous number of visitors recorded<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c013'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
in the year of the first of the great Industrial Exhibitions
(1851).</p>

<p class='c011'>It was during Sir A. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> decade that the largest
number of visitors ever recorded to have entered the Museum
within one day was registered. This exceptional number
occurred on the ‘Boxing Day’ of the Londoners, 26th
December, 1858, when more than forty-two thousand
visitors were admitted. Under the old system there had
been a dread of holiday crowds, and the largest number
ever admitted on any one day, prior to 1837, was between
five thousand eight hundred and five thousand nine hundred.
That number had been looked upon as a marvel. On the
Easter Monday of 1837, twenty-three thousand nine
hundred and eighty-five were admitted. Neither then nor
on the 1858 ‘Boxing Day’ was any injury or disorderly
conduct complained of.</p>

<p class='c011'>The highest number of visits for study made to the
Reading-Room, prior to 1857, occurred in 1850, when the
number was seventy-eight thousand five hundred and thirty-three.
The number in the year 1865 was one hundred
thousand two hundred and seventy-one, but in the interval
it had risen (1861) to one hundred and thirty thousand
four hundred and ten. For several years, between 1856
and 1866, the average number of visits for study to the
Galleries of Antiquities averaged about one thousand nine
hundred annually; those to the Print Room, about two
thousand eight hundred; those to the Coin and Medal
Room, about one thousand nine hundred.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span>The rapid growth of the Collection of Printed Books,
more especially between the years 1845–1865, which
had, as we have seen, resulted from the unremitting labours
of Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, was well kept up, both under his immediate
successor, Mr. John Winter <span class='sc'>Jones</span>, and (after Mr. <span class='sc'>Jones’</span>
promotion to the Principal-Librarianship, towards the close
of 1866) by the next Keeper, Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span>. As is well known,
the increase of the Library is still more remarkable for the
character of the additions purchased than for their mere
number. But recent years have afforded no such instance
of individual munificence in this department of the Museum
as that which will presently call for detailed notice when
we record the acquisition (in 1846) of the Grenville
Library, nor could any such instance, indeed, be reasonably
looked for.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sir Frederick <span class='sc'>Madden’s</span> energetic researches and labours
for the improvement of the Collection of MSS. would well
merit a fuller account than it is here practicable to give of
them. They have been perseveringly and worthily continued
by his successor, Mr. Edward Augustus <span class='sc'>Bond</span>, to whom
students also owe the great and distinctive debt of the commencement
of an admirable “<span class='sc'>Index of Matters</span>” to the
Collection generally. No greater boon, in the way of Catalogues,
was ever given within the walls of the Museum,
though, as yet, it is necessarily a beginning only. The special
labours of Dr. <span class='sc'>Gray</span> in that sphere, for the Natural-History
Collections, comprised the extended advantage of printing
and sale. Not less, I hope, will eventually be done for the
service of manuscript students. There is the desire to do it,
and the means must, sooner or later, follow.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wonderful growth and development of the Collections
of Antiquities in recent years is the special subject of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_601'>601</span>the next chapter. That growth derives no small part of
its permanent scientific interest and value from the impressive
way in which it illustrates the teachings of Holy
Scripture. <em>Some</em> of the collections amassed in the British
Museum have, more than once, by dint of human vanity,
been made to subserve a laudation of the wonderful
achievements of Man, rather than of the power, wisdom, and
goodness of God; but for the ebullitions of human vanity
there is extremely little room when a visitor stands beside
the sculptured memorials of that vast empire which ‘the
cedars in the garden of <span class='sc'>God</span> could not hide,’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Ezek. xxxi,
8 to 13.
Comp.
Habak. ii, 14.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
which was
‘lifted up in the pride of its height,’ only to become a
marvel for desolation, so that upon its ruin ‘the fowls of
the heaven remain.’ When before our own eyes and ears
the very stones cry out in the wall, and the beams out of
the timber answer them, the man vainest of his science
or of his philosophy must needs be led to ask himself:
‘What hath <span class='sc'>God</span> wrought?’</p>

<p class='c011'>Some very advanced men of science have become, of
late, fond of ‘Sunday-evening Lectures’ <em>for the instruction
of the working classes</em>. That would be a tolerably impressive
Sunday-evening Lecture which a competent scholar could
give in the Assyrian Gallery of the British Museum.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here, and now, the recent increase of the Department
of Antiquities may be wholly passed over. But to that
part of the history of accessions which bears upon the
Natural-History Galleries some attention must needs be
given, by way of continuing our former brief epitome of the
improvements made between the years 1836 and 1850.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the state of the Department of Zoology, during the
earlier part of the decade now more immediately under
review, a good and instructive account was given in Professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span><span class='sc'>Owen’s</span> Annual Report of 1861. Its most material
portions run thus:—</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The proportion of the stuffed specimens of the class
Mammalia, exhibited in the glazed cases of the Southern
Zoological Gallery and Mammalian Saloon, is in good condition.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The
Growth

History
Collections.
1850–1861.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The stuffed specimens, which, from their bulk, or
from want of space in the cases, stand on the floor, have
suffered in a certain degree from exposure to the corrosive
smoke-dust of the metropolis, the effects of which cannot
be wholly prevented.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The proportion, continues Mr. <span class='sc'>Owen</span>, of the Collection
of Mammalia consisting of skins preserved in boxes, the
Osteological specimens, including the horns and antlers, and
the specimens kept in spirit, are all in a good state of preservation.
The unstuffed, Osteological and bottled specimens
are unexhibited and restricted in use, as at present
located, to scientific investigation and comparison; but it is
with difficulty that the special visitor for such purposes can
now avail himself of these materials, owing to their crowded
accumulation in the Basement Rooms in which they are stored.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The exhibited Collection of Birds is in a good state of
preservation, is conveniently arranged for public inspection,
and is usefully and instructively named and labelled. The
interest manifested by visitors, and the satisfaction generally
expressed in regard to this gallery, indicate the amount of
public instruction and gratification which would result from
a corresponding serial arrangement and exposition of the
other classes of the animal kingdom.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The stuffed and exhibited selections from the classes of
Reptilia and Fishes, are in a very good state of preservation;
they suffer less from the requisite processes of cleaning
than the classes covered by hair, fur, or feathers.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of these cold-blooded Vertebrates the proportion preserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>in spirits is much greater than in Mammals and
Birds, and, consequently, through the present allotment of
space, the majority of the singular specific forms of Reptiles
and Fishes are excluded from public view. Upwards of two
thousand specimens in spirits of these classes have been added
in the past year to the previously crowded shelves of the
basement store-rooms, where access to any individual specimen
is a matter of some difficulty, if not hazard. Of the
above additions, fourteen hundred and fifty-six have accrued
from the donation of the Secretary of State for India in
Council. The interest and novelty of the specimens have
constrained their acceptance, and the same reason has led
to the acquisition of many additions from other sources.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Amongst them deserve to be specified two specimens
of that singular snake, the <em>Herpeton tentaculatum</em>, known
for a century past only by a single discoloured example in
the Paris Museum; those now in the stores of the British
Museum were acquired from Siam, and have served to
enrich Zoology with a complete knowledge of the species,
through the descriptions and figures by Dr. <span class='sc'>Günther</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The following may be also specified, namely, the burrowing
Snake from South Africa, <em>Uriechis microlepidotus</em>;
a new genus of tree-snake, <em>Herpetoreas</em>; a new genus,
<em>Barycephalus</em>, of Saurian, from an altitude in the Himalayas
of fifteen thousand feet above the level of the sea; also two
new species of freshwater Tortoise, the <em>Emys Livingstonii</em>,
dedicated to its discoverer in Africa, and the <em>Emys Siamensis</em>.
Among the additions to the class of Fishes has been
acquired a new genus, <em>Hypsiptera</em>, of the Scomberoid
family; with several new species, including one, <em>Centrolophus
Britannicus</em>, belonging to this country.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The specimens of the Molluscous classes showing the
entire animal, preserved in spirits, and stored in the basement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>room, are in good condition. The entire class of
<em>Tunicata</em> is so preserved; also the families or genera devoid
of, or with rudimental, shells, in the other Molluscous
classes. A small proportion of such “naked” Mollusca, and
the soft parts of a few of the testaceous kinds, are represented
by coloured wax models in the exhibited series of
shells arranged in the Bird Gallery.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The whole of the exhibited collection is in an excellent
state of preservation. The system or scale on which the
genera, species, and local varieties of shells are exhibited,
with their names and localities, gives to the ordinary visitor
a power of comparing his own specimens, and, in most
instances, of determining them, without the necessity of
special application to the keeper or assistant in the department.
The extent to which students and others avail
themselves of this facility of comparison, and the value
attached to it, show that the above principle and scale of
exhibition of specimens are proper to be adopted in a
National Museum for public use.’</p>

<p class='c011'>In the year following the presentation of this Report,
Professor <span class='sc'>Owen</span> made a more elaborate review, both of
the condition and of the needs of the Zoological Department,
from which I gather broadly, and by abridgement,
the following striking results:—</p>

<p class='c011'>The number of <em>species</em> of Mammals possessed by the
British Museum was a little over two thousand, exemplified
by about three thousand individual specimens. In the year
1830, the number of <em>specimens</em> had been about one thousand
three hundred and fifty; in 1850, it had risen to nearly
two thousand. It follows that, within thirty-two years, the
number of specimens in the Museum Collection had been
somewhat more than doubled. But still the number of
<em>species</em> adequately illustrated was only about two thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_605'>605</span>against three thousand five hundred species of Mammals
which are known, named, and have been more or less
adequately described, by zoologists.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of Birds, about two thousand five hundred species were,
in 1862, exhibited in the galleries of the British Museum,
and in its store-rooms there were the skins of about four
thousand two hundred species. The number of species
already known and described, in 1862, was not less than
eight thousand three hundred. And, it is hardly necessary
to add, vast explorations have since been undertaken, in the
years which have elapsed, or are now about to be undertaken
in Africa, in Madagascar, in Borneo, in New Guinea,
and in many parts of Australia.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of Fishes, the Museum contained, in 1862, about four
thousand species. These were then represented, by way
of public exhibition, irrespectively of the unexhibited stores,
by about one thousand five hundred stuffed specimens, illustrating
about one thousand species. The total number of
recorded species, already at that date, amounted to more
than eight thousand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of Reptiles, little more than two hundred and fifty
species were publicly shown in the Museum Galleries,
but its collections, unexhibited for want of space, were
already much larger. The number of known species of
<em>Reptilia</em>, in 1862, exceeded two thousand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Coming to the Invertebrata, it appears that, in 1862,
about ten thousand species of molluscs, illustrated by about
one hundred thousand specimen shells, were publicly
exhibited.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See, hereinafter,
Chap. VI.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This, it will be remembered, was anterior to
the great accession of the <span class='sc'>Cuming</span> Collection, which already,
in 1862, contained more than sixteen thousand <em>species</em>—and
is the finest and most complete series ever brought
together.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>About forty-five thousand specimens of molluscs were,
in 1862, stored in the drawers of the galleries and other
rooms, or in the vaults beneath. These, on a rough computation,
may have illustrated about four thousand five
hundred species.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within the <em>two years only</em>, 1860–1862, the registered
number of specimens of Fossils was increased from one
hundred and twenty thousand to one hundred and fifty-three
thousand, but of these it was found possible to exhibit
to the Public little more than fifty thousand specimens.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Growth of the Mineralogical Collections. 1858–1862.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Coming to the Department of Mineralogy, we find that
the registered specimens had increased, within about four
years, from fifteen thousand to twenty-five thousand. This
increase was mainly due to the acquisition of the noble
<span class='sc'>Allan-Greg</span> Cabinet formed at Manchester. But large as
this increase is, the national importance of the Mineralogical
Collections is very far from being adequately represented by
the existing state of the Museum series, even after all the
subsequent additions made between the years 1862–1870.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Owen,
<cite>Report</cite>, as
above (1862).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A Museum of Mineralogy worthy of England must eventually
include five several and independent collections.
There must be (1) a Classificatory Collection, for general
purposes; (2) a Geometrical Collection, to show the crystalline
forms; (3) an Elementary Collection, to show the
degrees of lustre and the varieties of cleavage and of colour;
(4) a Technological Collection, to show the economic application
of minerals—the importance of which, to a commercial,
manufacturing, and artistic country, can hardly be
exaggerated. Last of all, there is needed a special collection
of an ancillary kind; that, I mean, which has been
called sometimes a ‘teratological’ collection,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>(Ibid.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
sometimes a
‘pseudomorphic’ collection. Call it as you will, its object
<span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>is important. Such a series serves to show both the defective
and the excessive forms of minerals, and their transitional
capacities. These five several collections are, it will
be seen, over and above that other special Collection of
Sky-stones or ‘Meteorites,’ which is already very nobly represented
in our National Museum.</p>

<p class='c010'>We have now to turn to that vast field of research

has derived an augmentation that has sufficed to
double, within twenty-five years, its previous scientific and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span>literary value to the Public. In this chapter we have
to tell of not a little romantic adventure; of remote
and perilous explorations and excavations; sometimes, of
sharp conflicts between English pertinacity and Oriental
cunning; often, of great endurance of hardship and privation
in the endeavour at once to promote learning—the
world over—and to add some new and not unworthy entries
on the long roll of British achievement.</p>

<p class='c011'>Two distinct groups of explorers have now to be recorded.
The labours of both groups carry us to the Levant.

What
has been done of late years by the searchers after manuscripts,
in their effort to recover some of the lost treasures
of the old Libraries of the East, will be most fairly appreciated
by the reader, if, before telling of the researches and
the studies of <span class='sc'>Curzon</span>, <span class='sc'>Tattam</span>, <span class='sc'>Cureton</span>, and their fellow-workers
in Eastern manuscript archæology, some brief
prefatory notice be given of the earlier labours, in the
same field, of <span class='sc'>Huntington</span>, <span class='sc'>Browne</span>, and other travellers
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Mention
must also be made of the explorations of <span class='sc'>Sonnini</span>
and of <span class='sc'>Andréossi</span>.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The researches of Robert Huntington in the Nitrian Monasteries;</span></div>

<p class='c011'>About the year 1680, Robert <span class='sc'>Huntington</span>, afterwards
Bishop of Raphoe, visited the Monasteries of the Nitrian
Desert, and made special and eager research for the Syriac
version of the <cite>Epistles of St. Ignatius</cite>, of the existence of
which there had been wide-spread belief amongst the
learned, since the time of Archbishop <span class='sc'>Ussher</span>. But his
quest was fruitless, although, as it is now well known, a
Syriac version of some of those epistles did really exist in
one of the monasteries which <span class='sc'>Huntington</span> visited. The
monks, then as afterwards, were chary of showing their
MSS., very small as was the care they took of them. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>only manuscripts mentioned by <span class='sc'>Huntington</span>, in recording
his visits to three of the principal communities—St. Mary
Deipara, St. Macarius, and El Baramous—are an <cite>Old
Testament</cite> in the Estrangelo character; two volumes of
Chrysostom in Coptic and Arabic; a Coptic Lectionary
in four volumes; and a <cite>New Testament</cite> in Coptic and
Arabic.</p>

<p class='c011'>Towards the close of the following century, these
monasteries received the successive visits of <span class='sc'>Sonnini</span>, of
William George <span class='sc'>Browne</span>, and of General Count <span class='sc'>Andréossi</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>and those
of Sonnini,
Browne,
and others.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
<span class='sc'>Sonnini</span> says nothing of books. <span class='sc'>Browne</span> saw but
few—among them an Arabo-Coptic <cite>Lexicon</cite>, the works of
St. Gregory, and the <cite>Old</cite> and <cite>New Testaments</cite> in Arabic—although
he was told by the superior that they had nearly
eight hundred volumes, with none of which they would
part.

<cite>Travels in
Africa</cite>, &amp;c.,
p. 43.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
General <span class='sc'>Andréossi</span>, on the other hand, speaks
slightingly of the books as merely ‘ascetic works,&#160;...
some in Arabic, and some in Coptic, with an Arabic translation
in the margin;’
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Huntington,

but adds, ‘We brought away some
of the latter class, which appear to have a date of six
centuries.’ This was in 1799.

<span class='sc'>Sonnini de Manoncourt</span>, in 1812; Count <span class='sc'>Andréossi</span>
survived until 1828.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the year 1827, the late Duke of <span class='sc'>Northumberland</span>
(then Lord <span class='sc'>Prudhoe</span>) made more elaborate researches. His
immediate object was a philological one, his Lordship
desiring to further Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam’s</span> labours on a Coptic and
Arabic Dictionary.

Hearing that ‘Libraries were said to
be preserved, both at the Baramous and Syrian convents,’
he proceeded to El Baramous, accompanied by Mr.
<span class='sc'>Linart</span>, and encamped outside the walls. ‘The monks
in this convent,’ says the Duke, ‘about twelve in number,
appeared poor and ignorant. They looked on us with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>great jealousy, and denied having any books, except those
in the church, which they showed us.’ But having been
judiciously mollified by some little seductive present, on the
next day, ‘in a moment of good humour, they agreed to
show us their Library. From it I selected a certain
number of Manuscripts, which, with the <cite>Lexicon</cite> (<cite>Selim</cite>)
already mentioned, were carried into the monk’s room.
A long deliberation ensued,&#160;... as to my offer to
purchase them. Only one could write, and at last
it was agreed that he should copy the <cite>Selim</cite>, which copy
and the MSS. I had collected were to be mine, in exchange
for a fixed sum of dollars, to which I added a present of
rice, coffee, tobacco, and such other articles as I had to
offer.’ After narrating the acquisition of a few other
MSS. at the Syrian convent, or Convent of St. Mary Deipara,
his Lordship proceeds:—‘These manuscripts I presented to
Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam</span>, and gave him some account of the small
room with its trap-door, through which I descended, candle
in hand, to examine the manuscripts, where books, and
parts of books, and scattered leaves, in Coptic, Ethiopic,
Syriac, and Arabic, were lying in a mass, on which I stood....
In appearance, it seemed as if, on some sudden emergency,
the whole Library had been thrown down this trap-door,
and they had remained undisturbed, in their dust and
neglect, for some centuries.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The researches in the Levantine Monasteries of Mr. Curzon.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Ten years later, Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam</span> himself continued these
researches. But in the interval they had been taken up
by the energetic and accomplished traveller Mr. Robert
<span class='sc'>Curzon</span>, to whose charming <cite>Visits to the Monasteries of the
Levant</cite> it is mainly owing that a curious aspect of monastic
life, which theretofore had only interested a few scholars,
has become familiar to thousands of readers of all classes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Curzon’s</span> researches were much more thorough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>than those of any of his predecessors. He was felicitous
in his endeavours to win the good graces of the monks, and
seems often to have made his visits as pleasant to his hosts
as afterwards to his readers. But, how attractive soever,
only one of them has to be noticed in connexion with our
present topic—that, namely, to the Convent of the Syrians
mentioned already. ‘I found,’ says Mr. <span class='sc'>Curzon</span>, ‘several
Coptic MSS. lying on the floor, but some were placed in
niches in the stone wall. They were all on paper, except
three or four; one of them was a superb MS. of the
Gospels, with a commentary by one of the early fathers.
Two others were doing duty as coverings to large open pots
or jars, which had contained preserves, long since evaporated.
On the floor I found a fine Coptic and Arabic
Dictionary, with which they refused to part.’ After a most
graphic account of a conversation with the Father Abbot—the
talk being enlivened with many cups of rosoglio—he
proceeds to recount his visit to a ‘small closet, vaulted with
stone, which was filled to the depth of two feet or more
with loose leaves of Syriac MSS., which now form one of
the chief treasures of the British Museum.’ The collection
thus ‘preserved’ was that of the Coptic monks; the same
monastery contained another which was that of the
Abyssinian monks. ‘The disposition of the manuscripts
in the Library,’ continues Mr. <span class='sc'>Curzon</span>, ‘was very original....
The room was about twenty-six feet long,
twenty feet wide, and twelve feet high; the roof was
formed of the trunks of palm-trees. A wooden shelf was
carried, in the Egyptian style, around the walls, at the
height of the top of the door,&#160;... underneath the shelf
various long wooden pegs projected from the wall,&#160;... on
which hung the Abyssinian MSS., of which this curious
Library was entirely composed. The books of Abyssinia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>are bound in the usual way—sometimes in red leather, and
sometimes in wooden boards,&#160;... they are then enclosed in
a case,&#160;... to which is attached a strap,&#160;... and by these
straps the books are hung on the wooden pegs, three or four
on a peg, or more, if the books were small; their usual size
was that of a small, very thick quarto.... Almost all
Abyssinian books are written upon skins.... They have no
cursive writing; each letter is therefore painted, as it were,
with the reed-pen.... Some manuscripts are adorned with
the quaintest and grimmest illustrations conceivable,&#160;...
and some are worthy of being compared with the best specimens
of caligraphy in any language.’ Then follows an amusing
account of the ‘higgling of the monks,’ after a truly
Abyssinian fashion, ending in the acquisition of books, of the
whole of which the travellers could not, by any packing or
stuffing, make their bags containable. ‘In this dreadful
dilemma,&#160;... seeing that the quarto was the most imperfect,
I abandoned it; and I have now reason to believe, on seeing
the manuscripts of the British Museum, that this was the
famous book, with the date of <em>A.D.</em> 411, the most precious
acquisition to any Library that has been made in modern
times, with the exception, as I conceive, of some in my
own Collection.... <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Curzon,
<cite>Visits</cite>, &amp;c.,
as above.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This book, which contains some lost
works of Eusebius, has&#160;... fallen into better hands than
mine.’</p>

<p class='c011'>In the following year (1838), the Rev. Henry <span class='sc'>Tattam</span>
(afterwards Archdeacon of Bedford), in furtherance of the
purpose which had previously enlisted Lord <span class='sc'>Prudhoe’s</span>
co-operation, set out upon his expedition into Egypt. He
arrived at Cairo in October, and in November proceeded up
the Nile as far as Esneh, visiting many monasteries, and
inspecting their Libraries, in most of which he only met
with liturgies and service-books. Sanobon was an exception,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>for there he found eighty-two Coptic MSS., some
of them very fine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Continuing the narrative, we find that on the 12th of
January they started across the desert for the valley of the
Natron Lakes, and pitched their tent at a short distance
from the Monastery of Macarius.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Miss <span class='sc'>Platt’s</span>
Journal (unpublished,
but
abridged in
the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite>, as
above).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The monks told them
that of these convents there had once been, on the mountain
and in the valley of Nitria, no less than three hundred
and sixty. Of fifty or thereabouts the ruins, it is said,
may still be seen.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Researches
of Archdeacon
Tattam.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
At the Convent of the Syrians, the Archdeacon
was received with much civility, not, however, unaccompanied
by a sort of cautious circumspection. After a
look at the church, followed by the indispensable pipes and
coffee, the monks asked the cause to which they were indebted
for the honour of his visit. He told them discreetly
that it was his wish to see their books. ‘They replied
that they had no more than what he had seen in the church;
upon which he told them plainly that he knew they had.’
A conference ensued, and, on the next day, they conducted
him to the tower, and then into a dark vault, where
he found a great quantity of very old and valuable Syriac
MSS. He selected six quarto volumes, and took them to
the superior’s room. He was next shown a room in the
tower, where he found a number of Coptic and Arabic
MSS., principally liturgies, with a beautiful copy of the
<cite>Gospels</cite>. He then asked to see the rest. The monks
looked surprised to find he knew of others, and seemed at
first disposed to deny that they had any more, but at length
produced the key of the apartment where the other books
were kept, and admitted him. After looking them over,
he went to the superior’s room, where all the priests were
assembled, fifteen or sixteen in number; one of them
brought a Coptic and Arabic <cite>Selim</cite>, or <cite>Lexicon</cite>, which Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span><span class='sc'>Tattam</span> wished to purchase; they informed him they could
not part with it,&#160;... but consented to make him a copy.
He paid for two of the Syriac MSS. he had placed in the
superior’s room, for the priests could not be persuaded to
part with more.... The superior would have sold the
Dictionary, but was afraid, because the Patriarch had written
in it a curse upon any one who should take it away.’ [It
was the same volume which had been vainly coveted by
Mr. <span class='sc'>Curzon</span>, as well as by several preceding travellers, and
of which he tells us he ‘put it in one of the niches of the
wall, where it remained about two years, when it was purchased
and brought away for me by a gentleman at Cairo.’]
‘In the Convent of El Baramous,’ continues Miss <span class='sc'>Platt</span>,
‘Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam</span> found about one hundred and fifty Coptic
and Arabic liturgies, and a very large Dictionary in both
languages. In the tower is an apartment, with a trap-door
in the floor, opening into a dark hole, full of loose leaves of
Arabic and Coptic manuscripts.’ At the Monastery of
Amba-Bichoi, Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam</span> saw a lofty vaulted room, so
strewn with loose manuscripts as scarcely to afford a glimpse
of the floor on which they lay, ‘in some places a quarter of
a yard deep.’ At Macarius Convent a similar sight presented
itself, but of these Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam</span> was permitted to
carry off about a hundred.</p>

<p class='c011'>As the reader may well imagine, the charms of the
Syriac MSS. had made too deep an impression on Mr.
<span class='sc'>Tattam’s</span> heart to admit of an easy parting. Many were
the longing, lingering looks, mentally directed towards
them. Almost at the moment of setting out on his return
to Cairo, he added four choice books to his previous spoils.
In February, he resolved to revisit the convents, and once
more to ply his most persuasive arguments. He was manfully
seconded by his Egyptian servant, <span class='sc'>Mahommed</span>, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>favourite methods of negotiation much resembled those of
Mr. <span class='sc'>Curzon</span>. ‘The Archdeacon soon returned,’ says
Miss <span class='sc'>Platt</span>, ‘followed by <span class='sc'>Mahommed</span> and one of the
Bedouins, bearing a large sack full of splendid Syriac
MSS. on vellum. They were safely deposited in the tent.’
At Amba-Bischoi a successful bargain was struck for an
old <cite>Pentateuch</cite> in Coptic and Arabic, and a beautiful Coptic
<cite>Evangeliary</cite>. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Platt’s
Journal;
abridged, as
above.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On the next day, ‘Mahommed brought
from the priests a Soriana, a stupendous volume, beautifully
written in the Syriac characters, with a very old worm-eaten
copy of the <cite>Pentateuch</cite> from Amba-Bischoi, exceedingly
valuable, but not quite perfect.’ The remainder of
the story, or rather the greater part of what remains,
must here be more concisely told than in the words of
the reviewer.</p>

<p class='c011'>The manuscripts which Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam</span> has thus obtained,
in due time arrived in England. Such of them as were in
the Syriac language were disposed of to the Trustees of the
British Museum.... Forty-nine manuscripts of extreme antiquity,
containing some valuable works long since supposed
to have perished, and versions of others written several
centuries earlier than any copies of the original texts now
known to exist, constituted such an addition as has been
rarely, if ever, made at one time to any Library. The collection
of Syriac MSS. procured by Mr. <span class='sc'>Rich</span> had already
made the Library of the British Museum conspicuous for
this class of literature; but the treasure of manuscripts
from Egypt rendered it superior to any in Europe.</p>

<p class='c011'>From the accounts which Lord <span class='sc'>Prudhoe</span>, Mr. <span class='sc'>Curzon</span>,
and Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam</span> had given of their visits to the Monastery
of the Syrians, it was evident that but few of the manuscripts
belonging to it had been removed since the time of
<span class='sc'>Assemani</span>; and probable that no less a number than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>nearly two hundred volumes must be still remaining in the
hands of the monks. Moreover, from several notes in the
manuscripts&#160;... already brought to England, it was certain
that most of them must be of very considerable antiquity....
In several of these notices, <span class='sc'>Moses</span> of Tecrit states that, in
the year 932, he brought into the convent from Mesopotamia
about two hundred and fifty volumes. As there
was no evidence whatever to show that even so many as
one hundred of these MSS. had ever been taken away (for
those which were procured for the Papal Library by the
two <span class='sc'>Assemani</span>, added to those which Mr. <span class='sc'>Curzon</span> and
Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam</span> had brought to England, do not amount to
that number), there was sufficient ground for supposing
that the Convent of the Syrians still possessed not fewer
than about one hundred and fifty volumes, which, at the
latest, must have been written before the tenth century.
Application, accordingly, was made by the Trustees to the
Treasury; a sum was granted to enable them to send
again into Egypt, and Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam</span> readily undertook the
commission. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Treasury

The time was most opportune. Had much more
delay been interposed, these manuscripts, which, perhaps,
constitute the greatest accession of valuable literature
which has been brought from the East into Europe since
the taking of Constantinople,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Quart.

would, in all probability, have
been now the pride of the Imperial Library at Paris.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Mr. Tattam’s expedition to Nitria in 1842.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam</span> thought he could work most effectively
through the influence of a neighbouring Sheikh with the
superior of the convent. By which means he obtained,
after some delays, a promise that all the Syriac MSS.
should be taken to the Sheikh’s house, and there bargained
for. ‘My servant,’ he says, ‘had taken ten men and eight
donkeys from the village; had conveyed them, and already
bargained for them, which bargain I confirmed. That night
<span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>we carried our boxes, paper, and string, and packed them all....
Before ten in the morning they were on their way to
Alexandria.’ But, as will be seen in the sequel, the monks
were too crafty for Mr. <span class='sc'>Tattam</span> to cope with.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Tischendorf’s visit in 1844.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In 1844, <span class='sc'>Tischendorf</span> visited the monasteries already
explored by <span class='sc'>Curzon</span> and <span class='sc'>Tattam</span>. His account reproduces
the old characteristics:—‘Manuscripts heaped indiscriminately
together, lying on the ground, or thrown
into large baskets, beneath masses of dust.... The
excessive suspicion of these monks renders it extremely difficult
to induce them to produce their MSS., in spite of the
extreme penury which surrounds them.... But much
might yet be found to reward the labour of the searcher.’</p>

<p class='c011'>In truth, the monks, poor and simple as they sometimes
seemed to be, had taken very sufficient care to keep enough
of literary treasures in their hands to reward ‘further researches.’
Nearly half of their collection seems to have
been withheld.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Pacho’s negotiation for the recovery of the MSS. withheld by the monks of St. Mary Deipara.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>A certain clever Mr. <span class='sc'>Pacho</span> now entered on the scene as
a negotiator for the obtainment or recovery of the missing
‘treasures of the tombs.’ They had been virtually purchased
before, but the Lords of the Treasury very wisely re-opened
the public purse, and at length secured for the Nation an
inestimable possession. The new accession completed, or
went far towards completing, many MSS. which before
were tantalizingly imperfect.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See page 622,
in this
Chapter.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It supplied a second ancient
copy of the famous Ignatian <cite>Epistles</cite> (<em>to St. Polycarp</em>, <em>to
the Ephesians</em>, and <em>to the Romans</em>); many fragments of
palimpsest manuscripts of great antiquity, and among
them the greater part of St. Luke’s <cite>Gospel</cite> in Greek; and
about four thousand lines of the <cite>Iliad</cite>, written in a fine
square uncial letter, apparently not later than the sixth
century. The total number of volumes thus added to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>previous Nitrian Collections were calculated, roundly, to be
from a hundred and forty to a hundred and fifty.</p>

<p class='c010'>That the rich accession to our sacred literature, thus
made amidst many obstacles, should be turned speedily to
public advantage, two conditions had to be fulfilled.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>William
Cureton
and his
labours in
Oriental
Literature.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Skilful labour had first to be employed in the arrangement
of a mass of fragments. Scholars competently prepared,
by previous studies in Oriental literature and more especially
in Syriac, must then get to work on their transcription,
their gloss, and their publication. It could scarcely
have been expected, beforehand, that any one man would
be able to undertake both tasks, and to keep them, for
some years to come, well abreast. The fact, however,
proved to be so. The right man was already in the right
place for the work that was to be done.</p>

<p class='c011'>The late William <span class='sc'>Cureton</span> had entered the service of the
Trustees of the British Museum in 1837, at the age of
twenty-nine, when he had been already for about eight
years in holy orders. He was a native of Westbury,
in Shropshire. His education, begun at Newport School,
had been matured at Christ Church, Oxford. He had
been just about to enter himself at Christ Church in the
ordinary way, when his father died, suddenly, leaving
the family fortunes under considerable embarrassment.
<span class='sc'>Cureton</span>, and a brother of his, showed the metal they were
both made of, by instantly changing their youthful plans.
That the whole of the diminished patrimony might be at
their mother’s sole disposal, William <span class='sc'>Cureton</span> went to
Oxford as a servitor. His brother, instead of waiting for
his expected commission in the Army, enlisted as a private
dragoon. And certainly, in the issue, neither of these
young men lost any ‘dignity’—in any sense of that word—on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>account of the step so unselfishly taken at their start in
life.</p>

<p class='c011'>William <span class='sc'>Cureton</span> began his literary labours as a
Coadjutor-Under-Librarian in old Bodley. Dr. <span class='sc'>Gaisford</span>
introduced him to Dr. <span class='sc'>Bandinel</span>, in 1834, with the words:—‘I
bring you a good son. He will make a good librarian.’
It was at Oxford that he laid the substantial
foundation of his Oriental studies. After three years, he
followed the fashion already set him by some of the best
and ablest officers the Bodleian has ever had—<span class='sc'>Ellis</span>,
<span class='sc'>Baber</span>, and H. O. <span class='sc'>Coxe</span>, for example—by transferring,
for a time, his services from the great Library of Oxford to
that of London.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Cureton’s
entrance
into the
British
Museum.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
His first (or nearly his first) Museum
task was to set to work on the cataloguing of the Arabic
and Persian MSS. In 1842, he began his earliest Oriental
publication (undertaken for the ‘Oriental Text Society,’ to
be mentioned presently), namely, <span class='sc'>Al Sharastani’s</span> ‘<cite>Book
of Religious and of Philosophical Sects</cite>.’</p>

<p class='c011'>At the British Museum, he became quite as notable for
the amiability of his character, and the genial frankness of
his manners, as for his scholarly attainments and his power
of authorship. I have a vivid recollection of my own introduction
to him, in the February of 1839, and of the impression
made on me by his kindly and cordial greeting. When
I noted that pleasant face, which beamed with good nature
as well as with intellect, I instantly appreciated the force
of the words used by my introducer: ‘Let me make you
known,’ said he, ‘to my father-confessor.’ I thought the
choice to be obviously a felicitous one. Not less vivid is
my memory of the delight Mr. <span class='sc'>Cureton</span> manifested on receiving,
within the Museum <em>vaults</em>, the first importation
from the Nitrian Desert. The sight of such a mass of torn,
disorderly, and dirty fragments, would have appalled many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span>men not commonly afraid of labour, but to William
<span class='sc'>Cureton</span> the scholarly ardour of discovery made the task,
from the first, a pleasure. When successive fresh arrivals
gave new hope that many gaps in the manuscripts of
earliest importation would, in course of time, be filled up,
the laborious pleasure ripened into joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The collection, obtained by the long succession of
labours already narrated, reached the British Museum
on the first of May, 1843. When the cases were opened,
very few indeed of the MSS. were perfect.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Fragmentary
condition
of
the Syriac
MSS. imported
in
1843.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Nearly two
hundred volumes had been torn into separate leaves, and
then mixed up together, by blind chance and human stupidity.
It was a perplexing sight. But the eyes that looked
on it belonged to a seeing head. Even into a little chaos
like this, almost hopeless as at the first glance it seemed,
the learning, assiduity, and patience of Mr. <span class='sc'>Cureton</span>
gradually brought order. Of necessity, the task took a long
time. First came the separation of the fragments of different
works, and then the arrangement of the leaves into volumes,
with no aid to pagination or catchwords. With translations
of extant Greek works, the collection of their originals
gave, of course, great help. But in a multitude of cases
every leaf had to be read and closely studied.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within about eighteen months of the reception of the
MSS., Mr. <span class='sc'>Cureton</span> had ascertained the number of volumes—reckoning
books made up of fragments, as well as complete
works—to amount to three hundred and seventeen, of
which two hundred and forty-six were on vellum, and
seventy on paper; all in Syriac or Aramaic, except one
volume of Coptic fragments. With the forty-nine volumes
previously acquired, an addition was thus made to the MS.
Department of the National Library of three hundred and
sixty-six volumes. Many of these volumes contain two,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>three, or four distinct works, of different dates, bound together,
so that probably, in the whole, there were of manuscripts
and parts of manuscripts, upwards of one thousand,
written in all parts of Mesopotamia, Syria, and Egypt, and
at periods which range from the year 411 to the year 1292.
Of the specific character and contents of some of the
choicest of these MSS., mention will be made hereafter.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Dr. Cureton’s publications in Syriac, and in Arabic Literature.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>For several years, the labour on the Syriac fragments did
but alternate with that on the larger body of the Arabic
MSS., a classed catalogue of which Mr. <span class='sc'>Cureton</span> published
in 1846,—only a month or two after he had contributed
to the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> a deeply interesting and
masterly article on the Syriac discoveries. This paper was
quickly followed by his first edition of the <cite>Three Epistles
of St. Ignatius</cite> (I, to Polycarp; II, to the Ephesians; III,
to the Romans). In an able preface, he contended that, of
these genuine <cite>Epistles</cite>, all previous recensions were, to a
considerable extent, interpolated, garbled, and spurious;
and also that the other Ignatian <cite>Epistles</cite>, so-called, are entirely
supposititious. In the year 1870 it need hardly be
said either that this publication excited much controversy,
or that competent opinion is still divided on some parts of
the subject. But on two points there has never been any
controversy whatever:—As an editor, William <span class='sc'>Cureton</span>
displayed brilliant ability; as a student of theology, he was
no less distinguished by a single-minded search after truth.
He was never one of those noisy controversialists of whom
Walter <span class='sc'>Landor</span> once said, so incisively,<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c013'><sup>[35]</sup></a> that they were less
angry with their opponents for withstanding the truth, than
for doubting their own claims to be the channels and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>champions of Truth. To his dying day, <span class='sc'>Cureton</span> owned
himself to be a learner—even in Syriac.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within three years of the publication of his <cite>Ignatius</cite>,
<span class='sc'>Cureton</span> gave to the world his precious edition of the
fragmentary <cite>Festal Letters</cite> of <span class='sc'>Athanasius</span>, which Richard
<span class='sc'>Burgess</span> soon translated into English, and <span class='sc'>Lassow</span> into
German.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The foundation
of the
Oriental
Text Society.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The Syriac version was one of its editor’s earliest
discoveries amongst the spoils of the Nitrian monasteries,
and it was published at the cost of a new society, of which
<span class='sc'>Cureton</span> himself was the main founder. For the old
Oriental publication society<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c013'><sup>[36]</sup></a> limited itself, as its name
imports, to the publication of translations. The new one—the
claims of which to liberal support <span class='sc'>Cureton</span> was
never weary of vindicating—was expressly founded to print
Oriental texts. This new body had his strongest sympathies,
but he co-operated zealously with the ‘Translation
Fund’ as well as with the ‘Text Society,’</p>

<p class='c011'>Among his other and early labours, was the publication
of a Rabbinical Comment on the <cite>Book of Lamentations</cite>,
and of the Arabic text of <span class='sc'>En Nasafi’s</span> <cite>Pillar of the Creed
of the Sunnites</cite> (‘Umdat Akidat ahl al Sunnat wa al
Tamaat’), both of which books were printed in 1843.
After 1845, <span class='sc'>Cureton’s</span> literary labours were almost exclusively
devoted to that Syriac field in which he was to be so
large and so original a discoverer. The first distinctively
public recognition of his services was his appointment as a
Chaplain to the Queen, in 1847. Two years afterwards, he
was made a Canon of Westminster and Rector of St.
Margaret’s. Thenceforward, his energies were divided.
The charms of Syriac discovery were not permitted to obstruct
the due performance of the appropriate work of a
parish priest; though it is much to be feared that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_624'>624</span>were but too often permitted to interfere, more than a little,
with needful recreation and rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Among those of his parochial labours which demanded
not a small amount of self-sacrifice were the rebuilding
and the improved organization of the schools;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Parochial
labours.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the building
of a district church—St. Andrew’s—in Ashley Place; and
the establishment of Working-Class Lectures, upon a wise
and far-seeing plan.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Further contributions to literature.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In 1851, he gave to scholars the curious palimpsest fragments
of <span class='sc'>Homer</span> from a Nitrian manuscript (now <span class='sc'>Addit.
MS.</span>, 17,210), and, two years afterwards, the <cite>Ecclesiastical
History</cite> of <span class='sc'>John</span>, Bishop of Ephesus. This was quickly translated
into German by <span class='sc'>Schönfehler</span>, and into English by
Dr. R. Payne <span class='sc'>Smith</span>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>MS. <span class='sc'>Addit.</span>
14,640.
(B. M.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Then came the <cite>Spicilegium Syriacum</cite>,
containing fragments of <span class='sc'>Bardesanes</span>, of <span class='sc'>Melito</span> of
Sardes, and the inexpressibly precious fragments of an
ancient recension of the Syriac <cite>Gospels</cite>, believed by <span class='sc'>Cureton</span>
to be of the fifth century, and offering considerable and
most interesting divergences from the Peshito version.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a preface to these evangelical fragments of the fifth
century, their editor contends that they constitute a far
more faithful representation of the true Hebrew text than
does the Peshito recension, and that the remark holds good,
in a more especial degree, of the <cite>Gospel of St. Matthew</cite>.
This publication appeared in 1858.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Labour and its rewards in fresh labours.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Enough has been said of these untiring labours to make
it quite intelligible, even to readers the most unfamiliar
with Oriental studies, that their author had become already
a celebrity throughout learned Europe. As early as in
1855, the Institute of France welcomed Dr. <span class='sc'>Cureton</span>, as
one of their corresponding members, in succession to his
old master, <span class='sc'>Gaisford</span>, of Christ Church. In 1859, the
Queen conferred on him a distinction, which was especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>appropriate and dear to his feelings. He became ‘Royal
Trustee’ of that Museum which he had so zealously served
as an Assistant-Keeper of the MSS., up to the date of his
appointment to his Westminster parish and canonry. No
fitter nomination was ever made. Unhappily, he was not
to be spared very long to fill a function so congenial.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet one other distinction, and also one other and most
honourable labour, were to be his, before another illustrious
victim was to be added to the long list of public losses inflicted
on the country at large by the gross mismanagement,
and more particularly by what is called—sardonically,
I suppose—the ‘economy’ of our British railways. <span class='sc'>Cureton’s</span>
life too, like some score of other lives dear to literature
or to science, was to be sacrificed under the car of our
railway Juggernaut.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1861, he published, from another Nitrian manuscript,
<span class='sc'>Eusebius’</span> <cite>History of the Martyrs in Palestine</cite>.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The
removal,
and its
circumstances.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Early in
1863, he succeeded the late Beriah <span class='sc'>Botfield</span> in the Chair
of the Oriental Translation Fund. On the twenty-ninth
of May, of the same year, a railway ‘accident’ inflicted
upon him such cruel injuries as entailed a protracted and
painful illness of twelve months, and ended—to our loss,
but to his great gain—in his lamented death, on the seventeenth
of June, 1864.</p>

<p class='c011'>He died where he was born, and was buried with his
fathers. The writer of these poor memorial lines upon an
admirable man well remembers the delight he used to express
(thirty years ago) whenever it was in his power to
revisit his birthplace, and knows that the delight was shared
with the humblest of its inhabitants. Dr. <span class='sc'>Cureton</span> was
one of those genuine men who (in the true and best sense
of the words) are not respecters of persons. He had a
frank, not a condescending, salutation for the lowliest acquaintances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>of youthful days. And those lowliest were not
among the least glad to see his face again at his holiday-visits;
nor were they among the least sorrowful to see it,
when it bore the fatal, but now to most of us quite familiar,
traces of victimism to the mammon-cult of our railway
directors.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The archæological explorations in the Levant.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Just as we have to go very far back indeed in the history
of the Manuscript Department of the British Museum, in
order to find an accession quite as notable as are—taking
them as a whole—the manuscripts of the Nitrian monasteries,
so have we also to do in the history of the several
Departments of Antiquities, in order to find any parallel to
the acquisitions of monuments of art and archæology made
during the thirty years between 1840 and 1870. In point
of <em>variety</em> of interest, in truth, there is no parallel at all to
be found.</p>

<p class='c011'>In archæology, however—as in scientific discovery, or
in mechanical invention—every great burst of new light
will be seen, if we look closely enough, to have had its
remote precursive gleams, howsoever faint or howsoever
little noticed they may have been.</p>

<p class='c011'>Austen Henry <span class='sc'>Layard</span>, for example, is a most veritable
‘discoverer.’ Nevertheless, the researches of <span class='sc'>Layard</span> link
themselves with those of Claudius <span class='sc'>Rich</span>, and with the still
earlier glimpses, and the mere note-book jottings, of Carsten
<span class='sc'>Niebuhr</span>, as well as with the explorations of <span class='sc'>Layard’s</span>
contemporary and most able French fellow-investigator,
Monsieur <span class='sc'>Botta</span>. In like manner, Nathan <span class='sc'>Davis</span> is the
undoubted disinterrer of old Carthage, but the previous
labours of the Italian canon and archæologist <span class='sc'>Spano</span>, of
Cagliari, and those of the French geographers <span class='sc'>De Dreux</span>
and <span class='sc'>Dureau de La Malle</span>, imperfect as they all were,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>helped to put him upon the quest which was destined to
receive so rich a reward.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is obvious, therefore, that a tolerably satisfactory account
of the researches of the renowned archæologists mentioned
at the head of this chapter must be prefaced with
some notices of much earlier and much less successful
labours than theirs; and a thorough account would
need greatly more than that. But, at present, I cannot
hope to give either the one or the other. Rapid glances at
the recent investigations are all that, for the moment, are
permitted me, and for the perfunctory manner of these I
shall have to make not a little demand on the reader’s indulgence.
The subject-matter is rich enough to claim a
volume to itself; nor would the story be found to lack
well-sustained and varied interest, even if retold at large.</p>

<p class='c011'>The first inquiries and explorations in <cite>Lycia</cite> of Sir
Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span> began several years earlier than those in
<cite>Assyria</cite> of Mr. Austen <span class='sc'>Layard</span>, but an intelligible narrative
of what <span class='sc'>Layard</span> did, in 1845, must needs start with
a notice, be it ever so brief, of what <span class='sc'>Botta</span> had been doing
in 1842. The Lycian excavations were also effectively
begun in 1842. They were, in fact, contemporaneous
with the first excavations at Nineveh. I begin, therefore,
with the closely-linked labours of <span class='sc'>Botta</span> and of <span class='sc'>Layard</span>,
prefacing them with a glance at the previous pursuits and
aims in life of our distinguished fellow-countryman.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Austen Henry Layard and his early career.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Austen Henry <span class='sc'>Layard</span> is an Englishman, notwithstanding
his birth in Paris (5th of March, 1817), and his descent
from one of the many Huguenot families who (in one sense)
do honour to France for their sufferings for conscience
sake, and who (in many more senses than one) do honour
to England by the way in which zealous and persevering
exertions in the service of their adopted country have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>enabled them to pluck the flowers of fame, or of distinction,
from amidst the sharp thorns of adversity. Austen <span class='sc'>Layard</span>
is the grandson of the honoured Dr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span>, Dean of Bristol,
and he began active life, whilst yet very young, in a solicitor’s
office in the City of London. But he had scarcely reached
twenty-two years of age before family circumstances enabled
him to gratify a strong passion for Eastern travel. Archæology
had no share, at first, in the attractions which the
Levant presented to his youthful enterprise. But a fervid
nature, a good education, and a wonderful power of self-adaptation
to new social circumstances, made the mind of
the young traveller a fitting seedplot for antiquarian knowledge,
whenever the opportunity of acquiring it should
come.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The journey through Asia Minor and Syria in 1839–1840.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>To a man of that stamp it would be impossible that he
should tread near those ancient ruins, every stone of which
must needs connect itself with some ‘reverend history’
or other—when the discerning eye should at length pore
upon it and ponder it—without the ambition stirring within
him to make at least an earnest attempt to explore and to
decipher. To this particular man and his companion in
travel, Fortune was propitious, by dint of her very parsimony.
As he says himself: ‘No experienced dragoman
measured our distances or appointed our stations. We
were honoured with no conversations by pashas, nor did
we seek any civilities from governors. We neither drew
tears nor curses from the villagers by seizing their horses,
or searching their houses for provisions;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Nineveh and
its Remains</cite>
(1849), vol. i,
p. 2.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
their welcome was
sincere; their scanty fare was placed before us; we ate,
and came, and went in peace.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was almost thirty years ago—about the middle of
April, 1840—that Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span> looked upon those vast
ruins on the east bank of the Tigris, opposite Mósul, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>include the now famous mounds of Konyunjik and of
Nebbi Yunus. Having gazed on them with an incipient
longing—even then—to explore them thoroughly, he and
his companion rode into the desert, and looked with new
wonder at the great mound of Kàlàh Sherghat, the site of
which is by some geographers identified with the Assur of
the book Genesis.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c013'><sup>[37]</sup></a> After that hasty and tantalising visit,
in the spring of 1840, <span class='sc'>Layard</span> did not again see Mósul
until the summer of 1842, when he was again travelling
Tatar, and hurrying to Constantinople. In the interval, he
had often thought of his early purpose, and had talked of
it to many travellers. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Botta’s
first discoveries.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Now, in 1842, he heard that what he
had hitherto been able only to contemplate, as the wished-for
task of the future, Monsieur <span class='sc'>Botta</span>, the new French
Consul at Mósul, had, for some months, been actually
working upon; although, as yet, with very small success.
Our countryman encouraged the French Consul in his undertaking,
and presently learned that by him the first real
monument of old Assyria had been uncovered. This primary
discovery was not made at Kouyunjik, but at Khorsabad,
near the river Khauser, many miles away from the
place at which the first French excavations had been made,
early in 1842.</p>

<p class='c011'>The delighted emotions of Monsieur <span class='sc'>Botta</span>, when he
found himself, very suddenly, standing in a chamber in
which—to all probability—no man had stood since the
Fall of Nineveh, and saw that the chamber was lined with
sculptured slabs of ‘gypsum-marble’ or alabaster, full of
historic scenes from the wars and triumphs of Assyria, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_630'>630</span>reader can better imagine than a writer can describe.
<span class='sc'>Botta</span> himself rather indicates than depicts them, in the
deeply interesting letters which he speedily addressed to his
friend <span class='sc'>Mohl</span> at Paris (and which by <span class='sc'>Mohl</span> were not less
promptly published in the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal Asiatique</span></cite>, to be within
a month or two pondered and wondered over by almost
every archæologist in Europe). The delight, and also the
surprise, were enhanced when the discoverer saw that
almost every slab had a line of wedge-shaped characters
carved above it, giving hope of history in legible inscriptions,
as well as history in ruins. For, unhappily, nearly
all the sculptures <em>first</em> discovered at Khorsabad were fractured.
The durability of the Assyrian style of building
had brought about the defacement of the sculptured
records. The walls were formed of blocks of gypsum,
backed and lined, so to speak, with enormous masses of
clay. When the weight of such large earth-banks pressed
down upon the sculptured slabs, these were thrust from
their place. Many that were still in position, when first
seen, fell, or crumbled, as the explorer was looking at
them. He had to shore-up and underpin, as he went on;
and to do this by unpractised hands. Else, the more
diligent his excavations, the more destructive they would
have been of the very end he had in view.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Layard</span> was at Constantinople when the news came
of M. <span class='sc'>Botta’s</span> increasing successes. His detention there
had been unexpected, as well as unavoidable. But he
wrote to England without delay. He had a foresight
that <span class='sc'>Botta</span> would not lack encouragement in France. He
felt no unworthy jealousy on account of the fact that it
was a Frenchman who was now disinterring historic treasures
of a hitherto unexampled kind, and who was rapidly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span>securing historic fame for himself.<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c013'><sup>[38]</sup></a> Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span> knew—few
men just then knew more fully—that in all matters
of learning and of discovery the gains of France are the
gains of the world. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Layard’s
overtures
to the
British
Government.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For the staunchest of John Bulls
amongst us must acknowledge that in the arts of scientific
dissemination and exposition a Frenchman (other things
being equal) has usually twice the expertness of an Englishman.
But he was naturally desirous that France
should not have <em>all</em> the glory of Assyrian discovery. What,
then, was the reception with which his first overtures were
met? ‘With a single exception,’ in the person of his
London correspondent, ‘no one,’ he tells us, ‘in England’&#160;...
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Nineveh and
its Remains</cite>,
vol. i, p. 10.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘seemed inclined to assist or take any interest in
such an undertaking.’</p>

<p class='c011'>What, on the other hand, were the encouragements given
to the French explorer by the Government and the Nation
of France? They were large; they were ungrudgingly
given; and they were instantaneously sent. In Mr.
<span class='sc'>Layard’s</span> words: ‘The recommendation was attended to
with that readiness and munificence which [has] almost
invariably distinguished the French Government in undertakings
of this nature.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Liberal aid
extended
to M. Botta
by the
French
Government.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Ample funds to meet the cost of
extensive excavations were at once assigned to M. <span class='sc'>Botta</span>,
and an artist of acknowledged skill was placed under his
orders, to draw such parts of the monuments discovered as
could not be preserved or removed.’ Who will wonder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>that at first it seemed as though France would carry off all
the stakes, and England have no place at all in the archæological
race?</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Contrasts:—England and France.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span>, however, was otherwise minded. And he
found, presently, a powerful helper in the person of the
British Ambassador at Constantinople, Sir Stratford <span class='sc'>Canning</span>
(now Lord Stratford de Redcliffe). Had it not been
for the union, in that ambassador, of a large intellect, a
liberal mind, and a strong will, and also for the <em>absence</em>, in
him, of that shrinking from extra-official responsibilities
which in so many able men has often emasculated their
ability, Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard’s</span> efforts, earnest and unremitting as
they were, would assuredly have been foiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>The reader will perceive that for what was achieved, in
1845 and in the subsequent years, on the banks of the
Tigris, the British public owe a debt of gratitude to Lord
<span class='sc'>Stratford de Redcliffe</span>, the encourager of the enterprise,
as well as to Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span>, its originator.</p>

<p class='c011'>But neither does this fact, nor does the like of it, five
years earlier, in the help given by Lord <span class='sc'>Ponsonby</span> to the
Lycian researches of Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span>, invalidate or
weaken the remark I have ventured to make (on pages
348; 381, of the present volume, and elsewhere) about the
discreditable and long-continued apathy of our Foreign
Office in matters of art and literature; especially if we
compare on that head British practice with French practice.
Perhaps, at first blush, it might be thought somewhat
presumptuous, in a private person, to remark so freely
on what seem to him the shortcomings of statesmen. But
it has to be borne in mind that, in such cases as this, outspoken
criticism is rather the expression of known public
opinion, than of mere individual judgment. The one
writer, how humble soever, is very often the mouthpiece of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>the thoughts of many minds. Nor is other warrant for
such criticism lacking.</p>

<p class='c011'><em>Three years</em> after beginning his excavations at Nimroud,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span> himself wrote thus (from Cheltenham):—‘It is
to be regretted that proper steps have not been taken for
the transport to England of the sculptures discovered at
Nineveh. Those which have already reached this country,
and (it is to be feared) those which are now on their way,
have consequently suffered <em>unnecessary</em> injury;&#160;...
yet,&#160;...
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Nineveh and
its Remains</cite>,
vol. i, p. xiii.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
they are almost the only remains of a great city
and of a great nation.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Part of the injury now observable in the Assyrian sculptures
of the British Museum was, of course, inseparable
from circumstances attending the discovery. Besides the
injury already spoken of—from the pressure of the earth-banks—all
the low-reliefs of one great palace had suffered
from intense heat. From this cause, Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard’s</span> experiences
recall, in one particular, the impressive accounts we
have all read of the opening of ancient tombs in Egypt
and in Italy. The fortunate excavator suddenly beheld a
kingly personage, in fashion as he lived. The royal forehead
was still encircled by a regal crown. The fingers
were decked with rings; the hand, mayhap, grasped a
sceptre. But whilst the discoverer was still gazing in the
first flush of admiration, the countenance changed; the ornaments
crumbled; the sceptre and the hand that held it
alike became dust. So it was, at times, at Nimroud. Some
of the calcined slabs presented, for a moment, their story
in its integrity. Presently, they fell into fragments.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Mixed nature of the causes of the mutilations observable in the Museum Sculptures from Assyria.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>None the less, when the reader goes into the Kouyunjik
Gallery; looks at the sculptures from <span class='sc'>Sennacherib’s</span>
palace; observes the innumerable ‘joinings,’ and then
glances at his official ‘<cite>Guide</cite>’ (which tells him, at page 85,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_634'>634</span>‘many single slabs reached this country in three hundred or
four hundred pieces’), he is bound for truth’s sake to remember
that, whilst some of the breakage is ascribable to
the action of fire at the time of the Fall of Nineveh,
another portion of it is ascribable to the want or absence
of action, on the part of some worthy officials in the public
service of Britain, just twenty-five centuries afterwards.</p>

<p class='c010'>With Sir Stratford <span class='sc'>Canning’s</span> help, and with the still
better help of his own courage and readiness of resource,
Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span> surmounted most of the obstacles which lay
in his path. There was a rich variety of them. To quote
but a tithe of his encounters with Candian pashas, Turcoman
navvies, Abou-Salman visitors, and Mósul cadis and
muftis, would ensure the reader’s amusement beyond all
doubt; but the temptation must be overcome. Happily,
the original books are well known, though the anecdotes
are more than racy enough to bear quotation and requotation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Layard’s first discovery</span>, 28th Nov., 1845.</div>

<p class='c011'>Two incidents of the first explorations (1845–46) must
needs be told. The earliest discovery was made on the twenty-eighth
of November. The indications of having approached,
at length, a chamber lined with sculpture, rejoiced the Arab
labourers not less than it rejoiced their employer. They
kept on digging long after the hour at which they were
accustomed to strike work. The slab first uncovered was
a battle-scene. War chariots drawn by splendidly equipped
horses contained three warriors apiece, in full career. The
chief of them (beardless) was clothed in complete mail, ‘and
wore a pointed helmet on his head, from the sides of which
fell lappets covering the ears, the lower part of the face, and
the neck. The left hand (the arm being extended) grasped
a bow at full stretch; whilst the right, drawing the string to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_635'>635</span>the ear, held an arrow ready to be discharged. A second
warrior urged, with reins and whip, three horses to the
utmost of their speed.... A third, without helmet and with
flowing hair and beard, held a shield for the defence of the
principal figure. Under the horses’ feet, and scattered
about, were the conquered, wounded by the arrows of the
conquerors. I observed with surprise the elegance and
richness of the ornaments, the faithful and delicate delineation
of the limbs and muscles, both in the men and
horses, and the knowledge of art displayed in the grouping
of the figures and the general composition. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Nineveh and
its Remains</cite>
(1849), vol. i,
p. 41.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In all these
respects, as well as in costume, this sculpture appeared to
me, not only to differ from, but to surpass, the bas-reliefs
of Khorsabad.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus cheered, the work of digging went on with fresh
vigour, and in new directions. Parts of a building which
had suffered from decay, not from fire, were at length uncovered.
Slabs of still greater beauty were disclosed. ‘I now
thought,’ says the explorer, ‘I had discovered the earliest
palace of Nimroud.’</p>

<p class='c011'>On the morning after the discovery of these new and
more choice sculptures—middle of February, 1846—Mr.
<span class='sc'>Layard</span> rode away from the mound to a distant Arab encampment—wisely
cultivating, as was his manner, a good
understanding with a ticklish sort of neighbours. Two early
Arabs, from this camp, had already paid a morning visit to
the mound. They hastened back at a racing pace. Before
they could well pull up their horses, or regain their own
Oriental composure, the riders shouted at sight of Layard:
‘Hasten, O Bey, to the diggers. They have found great
<span class='sc'>Nimrod</span> himself. Wallah! it is wonderful, but it is true!
We have seen him with our eyes.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The ‘Bey’ did not wait for lucid explanations; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_636'>636</span>urged his horse to emulate the speed with which the grateful,
though mysterious, tidings had been brought to him. No
sooner had he entered the new trench at the mound, than
he saw a splendidly sculptured head, the form of which
assured him at a glance that it must belong to a winged
bull or lion like to those of Persepolis and of Khorsabad.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><em>Ibid.</em>, p. 65.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Its preservation was perfect, its features sharply cut. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>1846,
February.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The
Arab workmen stood looking at it with intent and fear-expressing
eyes—but with open palms. The first word
that came from their lips begged a ‘back-sheesh,’ in honour
of the auspicious occasion. The terror of one of them,
only, had led him to scamper at full speed to his tent, that
he might hide himself from the frightful monster whose
aspect seemed to threaten vengeance on those rash men
who had dared to disturb his long repose, in the bowels of
the earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>Scarcely had Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span> glanced at ‘<span class='sc'>Nimrod</span>’ before
he found that more than half the tribe whose encampment
he had just left had followed hard at his heels. They were
headed by their Sheikh. It would be difficult to depict, in
few words, the conflict of their feelings. Admiration, terror,
anger, had each a part in the emotion which was evinced, no
less in their gestures than in their words. ‘There is no God
but <span class='sc'>God</span>, and <span class='sc'>Mahomed</span> is his prophet! <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><em>Ibid.</em>, p. 66.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
This is not the
work of men’s hands, but of those infidel giants whom the
Prophet—peace be with him!—has said, that “they were
higher than the tallest date-tree.” This is one of the idols
which <span class='sc'>Noah</span>—peace be with him!—cursed before the
Flood.’ Such were the words of Sheikh <span class='sc'>Abd-ur-rahman</span>
himself. He showed great reluctance, at first, to enter the
trench. But when once in, he examined the image with
great and continued earnestness. All his followers echoed
his verdict.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_637'>637</span>But the townspeople of Mósul were more difficult to deal
with. The Cadi called a meeting of the Mufti and the
Ulema, to discuss the most effectual protest against such
an atrocious violation of the Koran as that committed by
the unbelieving explorer and his mercenary labourers.
Their notions about <span class='sc'>Nimrod</span> were very vague. Some
thought him to have been an ancient true-believer; others
had a strong misgiving that he, like his unearther, was
but an infidel. They were all clear that the digging must be
stopped.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Nineveh and
its Remains</cite>;
passim.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It tasked all Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard’s</span> skill, experience, and
force of character, to surmount these new difficulties. When
they had been at length overcome—with the brilliant
results known now to most Englishmen—he had to face
the enormous difficulties of transport. The great human-headed
lions he was obliged to leave in their original position.
A multitude of smaller sculptures (many of them
reduced in bulk by sawing) were safely brought to England.
The first arrivals came in 1847.<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c013'><sup>[39]</sup></a> In 1849 and in 1850,
the excavations in the mounds first opened were vigorously
resumed, and new researches were made in several directions.
Early in 1850, the explorers buckled to the task of
removing the lions. That chapter in Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard’s</span> familiar
narrative is not the least interesting one.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_638'>638</span>The explorations partially interrupted in 1847 were
resumed in 1849.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon</cite> (1853), pp. 162, 163; 201–209; seqq. Dec., 1849.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
From the October of that year until
April, 1851, they were carried on with even more than the
old energy, for the means and appliances were more ample,
and the encouragements drawn from success followed each
other in far quicker succession.</p>

<p class='c011'>The suspension had been but partial, for Mr. Hormuzd
<span class='sc'>Rassam</span>, then British Vice-Consul at Mósul, had been
empowered to keep a few men still digging at Kouyunjik.
He had there unearthed several new sculpture-lined chambers
of no small interest. But at Nimroud nothing worthy
of mention had been done during <span class='sc'>Layard’s</span> absence. That
was now his first object.

Kouyunjik, however, for a long
time gave the best yield.</p>

<p class='c011'>In December the south-east façade of the Kouyunjik
Palace was uncovered. It was found to be a hundred and
eighty feet in length, and contained, among other sculptures,
ten colossal bulls and six human figures. The
accompanying inscriptions contained the early annals of
<span class='sc'>Sennacherib</span>, and of his wars with <span class='sc'>Merodach Baladan</span>.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c013'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>Presently, the labours on the north-west palace at Nimroud
were also richly rewarded. The somewhat higher
antiquity of that building, as compared with the homogeneous
structures of Kouyunjik and Khorsabad, had already
impressed itself with the force of conviction on Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard’s</span>
individual mind. The fact now became manifest to all eyes
that had the capacity to see.</p>

<p class='c011'>These Nimroud monuments belong,—according to the
opinion of the best archæologists,—most of them, to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_639'>639</span>eighth, some of them, however, to the earlier part of the
seventh centuries <em>B.C.</em> They now occupy the most central
of the Assyrian Galleries in the British Museum. The
monuments of Kouyunjik and of Khorsabad are probably
but little anterior to the supposed date (625 <em>B.C.</em>) of the
destruction of Nineveh. These are exhibited in galleries
adjacent to the ‘Nimroud Central Saloon.’ To describe
only a few of them in connection with the interesting circumstances
of their respective disclosures would demand
another chapter. A word or two, however, must be given
to one among the earlier discoveries (October, 1846), and
to one among the latest of those made (in the spring of
1851), whilst Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span> himself remained in the neighbourhood
of Mósul.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Discovery of the black-marble obelisk</span>, 1846, October (found in centre of the great mound).</div>

<p class='c011'>At Nimroud many trenches had, in those early days, been
opened unprofitably. Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span> doubted whether he
ought to carry them further. Half inclined to cease, in this
direction, he resolved, finally, that he would not abandon
a cutting on which so much money and toil had been spent,
until the result of yet another day’s work was shown.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Nineveh and

‘I
mounted my horse,’ he says—to ride into Mósul—‘but had
scarcely left the mound when a corner of black marble was
uncovered, lying on the very edge of the trench.’ It was
part of an obelisk seven feet high, lying about ten feet
below the surface. Its top was cut into three gradines,
covered with wedge-shaped inscriptions. Beneath the
gradines were five tiers of sculpture in low-relief, continued
on all sides. Between every two tiers of sculpture ran a
line of inscription. Beneath the five tiers, the unsculptured
surface was covered with inscriptions. These, as subsequent
researches have shown, contain the Annals of <span class='sc'>Shalmaneser</span>,
King of Assyria, during thirty-one years towards
the close of the ninth century before our Lord. The tributaries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_640'>640</span>of the great monarch are seen in long procession,
bearing their offerings. In the appended cuneiform record
of these tributaries are mentioned <span class='sc'>Jehu</span>, ‘of the House of
<span class='sc'>Omri</span>,’ and his contemporary <span class='sc'>Hazael</span>, King of Syria. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><em>Ibid.</em>, 346.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Well
may the proud discoverer call his trophy a ‘precious relic.’</p>

<p class='c010'>We now leap over more than four eventful years. Mr.
<span class='sc'>Layard</span> is about to exchange the often anxious but always
glorious toils of the successful archæologist, for the not less
anxious and very often exceedingly inglorious toils of the politician.
He will also henceforth have to exchange many a
pleasant morning ride and many a peaceful evening ‘tobacco-parliament’
with Arabs of the Desert, for turbulent discussions
with metropolitan electors, and humble obeisances
in order to win their sweet voices. Just before he leaves
Mósul come some new unearthings of Assyrian sculpture,
to add to the welcome tidings he will carry into England.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The discoveries at Kouyunjik of the spring of 1851.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>He found, he tells us—in one of the closing chapters of
his latest book—that to the north of the great centre-hall
four new chambers, full of sculpture, had been discovered.
On the walls of a grand gallery, ninety-six feet by twenty-three,
was represented the return of an Assyrian army
from a campaign in which they had won loads of spoil
and a long array of prisoners. The captured fighting
men wore a sort of Phrygian bonnet reversed, short tunics,
and broad belts. The women had long tresses and fringed
robes.

Sometimes they rode on mules or were drawn—by
men as well as by mules—in chariots. The captives
were the men and women of Susiana. The victor was
<span class='sc'>Sennacherib</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>In several subsequent years—1853, 1854, 1855, when
most Englishmen were intently acting, or beholding with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>suspended breath, the great drama in the Crimea—a famous
compatriot was continuing the task so nobly initiated by
Austen <span class='sc'>Layard</span>. Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Rawlinson</span> (made by this
time Consul-General at Baghdad) carried on new excavations,
both at Nimroud and at Kouyunjik. In these he
was ably assisted by Mr. W. K. <span class='sc'>Loftus</span>, as well as by Mr.
Hormuzd <span class='sc'>Rassam</span>, the helper and early friend of <span class='sc'>Layard</span>,
and (in the later stages) by Mr. <span class='sc'>Taylor</span>. Another obelisk,
with portions of a third and fourth; thirty-four slabs
sculptured in low-relief; one statue in the round; and a
multitude of smaller objects, illustrating with wonderful
diversity and minuteness the manners and customs, the
modes of life and of thought, as well as the wars and
conquests, the luxury and the cruelty, of the old Assyrians,
were among the treasures which, by the collective labour
of these distinguished explorers, were sent into Britain.

Another ‘recension,’ so to speak, of the early Annals of
<span class='sc'>Sennacherib</span>, King of Assyria, inscribed upon a cylinder,
was not the least interesting of the monuments found under
the direction of Sir Henry <span class='sc'>Rawlinson</span>, whose name had
already won its station—many years before his consulship
at Baghdad—beside those of <span class='sc'>Grotefend</span>, of <span class='sc'>Burnouf</span> and
of <span class='sc'>Lassen</span>, in the roll of those scientific investigators by
whose closet labours the researches and long gropings
of the <span class='sc'>Riches</span>, the <span class='sc'>Bottas</span>, and the <span class='sc'>Layards</span>, were destined
to be interpreted, illustrated, and fructified for the
world of readers at large.</p>

<p class='c011'>For it is not the least interesting fact in this particular
and most richly-yielding field of Assyrian archæology—that
several men in Germany;—more than one man
in France;—and one man, at least, in Persia, had been
working simultaneously, but entirely without concert, at
those hard and, for a time, almost barren studies which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_642'>642</span>were eventually to supply a master-key to vast libraries of
inscriptions brought to light after an entombment of twenty-five
hundred years.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The travels and researches of Sir Charles Fellows in Lycia.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Scarcely smaller than the debt of gratitude which Britain
owes to Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard</span> and to Lord <span class='sc'>Stratford de Redcliffe</span>,
for the Marbles and other antiquities of Assyria, is the
debt which she owes to the late Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span> for
those of Lycia. Nor ought it to be passed over without
remark that the admirably productive mission to the Levant
of Mr. Charles <span class='sc'>Newton</span> seems to have grown, in germ, out
of the applications made at Constantinople on behalf of
Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span>. In that merit he has but a very small
share. The merit of the Lycian discoveries is all his own.
He has now gone from amongst us,—like most of the benefactors
whose public services have been recorded in this
volume. How inadequate the record; how insufficient for
the task the chronicler; no one will be so painfully conscious,
as is the man whose hand—in the absence of a better
hand—has here attempted the narrative. The Museum story
has been long. What remains to be said must needs be
put more briefly. But because Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span> has
been so lately removed from the land he served with so
much zeal and ability, I shall still venture to claim the
indulgence of my readers for a somewhat detailed account
of the work done in Lycia, and of the man who did it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The analogies and the contrasts between Fellows and Layard.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In one respect, it was with Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span> as with
Austen <span class='sc'>Layard</span>. A youthful passion for foreign travel,
and what grew out of that, lifted each of them from
obscurity into prominence. But <span class='sc'>Layard</span> achieved fame at
a much earlier age than did Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span>. Sir
Charles was almost forty before his name came at all before
the Public. <span class='sc'>Layard</span> was already a personage at eight and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>twenty. This small circumstantial difference between the
fortune of two men whose pursuits in life were, for a time,
so much alike, deserves to be kept in mind, on this account:
Sir Charles lived scarcely long enough to see any fair
appreciation of what he had accomplished. Even those
whose political sympathies incline them to a belief that Mr.
<span class='sc'>Layard’s</span> <em>official</em> services will never suffice to console Englishmen
for the interruption of his archæological services,
hope that he may live long enough to enjoy a rich reward
for the latter in their yearly-increasing estimation by his
countrymen at large. They will delight to see the fervid
member for Southwark utterly eclipsed in the fame of the
great discoverer of long-entombed Assyria.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The travels in Asia Minor, and what grew thereout.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span> was the son of Mr. John <span class='sc'>Fellows</span>,
of Nottingham. He was born in 1799. In the year 1837,
he set out upon a long tour in Asia Minor. Archæological
discovery no more formed any part of a preconcerted plan in
Mr. <span class='sc'>Fellows’</span> case than it did, two or three years afterwards,
in Mr. <span class='sc'>Layard’s</span>. Both were led to undertake
their respective explorations in a way that (for want of a
more appropriate word) we are all accustomed to call
‘accidental.’</p>

<p class='c011'>In February, 1838, he found himself at Smyrna. After
a good deal of observation of men and manners, he betook
himself to an inspection of the buildings.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Journal
written
during an
Excursion in
Asia Minor</cite>,
pp. 8, seqq.
(edit. 1852).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He soon found
that not a little of the modern Smyrna was built out of the
ruins of the Smyrna of the old world. Busts, columns,
entablatures, of white marble and of ancient workmanship,
were everywhere visible, in close admixture with the recently-quarried
building-stone of the country and the
period. But not only had the old marbles been built into
the new edifices; they had been turned into tombstones.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_644'>644</span>Certain Jews, of an enterprising and practical turn of mind,
had bought, in block, a whole hill-full of venerable marbles,
in order to have an inexhaustible supply of new tombstones
close at hand. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><em>Ibid.</em>, p. 9.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In another part of the suburbs of the town,
the walls of a large corn-field turned out, on close examination,
to be built of thin and flat stones, of which the inner
surface was formed of richly-patterned mosaic, black, white,
and red. From that day, the traveller, wheresoever he
journeyed, was a scrutinising archæologist. And the traveller,
thus equipped for his work, was busied, two months
afterwards, in exploring that most interesting part of Asia
Minor (a part now called ‘Anadhouly’), which includes
Lydia, Mysia, Bithynia, Phrygia, Pisidia, Lycia, Pamphylia,
and Caria; and much of which was never before trodden—so
far as is known, and the knowledge referred to is that of
the best geographers in England, discussing this matter
expressly, at a meeting of the Geographical Society—by the
feet of any European.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c013'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The explorations in Antiphellus and its vicinity.</span> 1838, April.</div>

<p class='c011'>On the eighteenth of April, Mr. <span class='sc'>Fellows</span> found himself
in the romantically beautiful, but rugged and barren, neighbourhood
of Antiphellus. The ancient town of that name
possessed a theatre, and a multitude of temples, grandly
placed on a far-outjutting promontory. For miles around,
the rocks and the ravines were strewn with marble fragments.
The face of the cliff, which, on one side, overhangs
the town, was seen to be deeply indented with rock-tombs,
richly adorned. They contained sarcophagi of a special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_645'>645</span>form. The lid of each of them bore a rude resemblance to
a pointed arch. It sounds at first almost grotesquely, in
the ear of a reader of Mr. <span class='sc'>Fellows’</span> <cite>Journal</cite> of 1839, to
hear him speak of Lycian tombs as ‘Elizabethan’ in their
architecture. But, in the sense intended, the term is
strictly apposite. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Journal of an
Excursion</cite>,
&amp;c., as above,
p. 164.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If the reader will but glance at one of
Mr. <span class='sc'>Fellows’</span> many beautiful plates of those rock-tombs,
he will see at once that they look not unlike the stone-mullioned
windows of our own Tudor age.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the discovery which eclipsed all Mr. <span class='sc'>Fellows’</span>
previous researches was that of the ancient capital of Lycia—Xanthus.
Next in importance to that was his disinterment
of Tlos. He saw the ruins of other and, in their
day, famous towns. It was plain that he had now before
him a fine opening to add to the stores of human knowledge
in some of its grandest departments—artistic, historical,
biblical. But, in 1838, he had not the most ordinary
appliances of minute research. He went back to
England; found (as <span class='sc'>Layard</span> was also destined to find, very
shortly afterwards) only a very little encouragement, at
official hands; much more than a little, however, in his own
reflections and foresight.

In 1839, he went back to Lycia,
taking with him George <span class='sc'>Scharf</span>, then carefully described
as ‘a young English artist,’ now widely known as an
eminent archæologist. <span class='sc'>Fellows</span> explored. <span class='sc'>Scharf</span> drew.
Early in 1840, ten Lycian cities were added to the previous
discoveries. Each of them contained many precious works
of ancient art.</p>

<p class='c011'>In order to effectual excavation, and in order also to the
safety of what was found from destruction by Turkish barbarities,
the Sultan’s firman was essential. The difficulties
were much like those which, as I have had occasion to show
<span class='pageno' id='Page_646'>646</span>in ‘Book Second,’ lay in the path of Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span>, under
similar circumstances, more than forty years earlier. By
Lord <span class='sc'>Ponsonby’s</span> zealous efforts, they were at length surmounted.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See Book II,

At the earnest instance of the Museum Trustees,
the Government at home seconded the exertions of their
ambassador at Constantinople; and this combination of
endeavour made that feasible which the best energies of
Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span>, single handed, must have utterly failed
to secure.</p>

<p class='c011'>The reader will not, I incline to think, regard as an
instance of overmuch detail, if I here add—for instructive
comparison with the terms of the official letter procured by
Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span>—the words in which <span class='sc'>Rifaat</span> Pasha, in June,
1841, describes the antiquities, the removal whereof was to
be graciously permitted. In 1800, Lord <span class='sc'>Elgin</span> (after enormous
labour) was empowered to ‘take away any pieces of
stone, from the Temples of the Idols, with old inscriptions
or figures thereon.’ Now—in 1841—the ‘pieces of stone’
are described as ‘antique remains and rare objects.’
The schoolmaster, it will be seen, had been at work at
Constantinople.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The researches at Cadyanda, Pinara, &amp;c.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The explorations at Cadyanda, at Pinara, and at Sidyma,
richly merit the reader’s attention, as an essential part of
our present subject. But happily Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows’</span> books
are both accessible and popular. Here we must hasten on
to Xanthus, and Sir Charles’ story must now be told in his
own expressive and graphic words:</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The excavations at Xanthus.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>‘Xanthus certainly possesses some of the earliest Archaic
sculpture in Asia Minor, and this connected with the most
beautiful of its monuments, and illustrated by the language
of Lycia. These sculptures to which I refer must be the
work of the sixth or seventh centuries before the Christian
era, but I have not seen an instance of these remains having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_647'>647</span>been despoiled for the rebuilding of walls; and yet the
decidedly more modern works of a later people are used as
materials in repairing the walls around the back of the
city and upon the Acropolis; many of these have Greek
inscriptions, with names common among the Romans.
The whole of the sculpture is Greek, fine, bold, and simple,
bespeaking an early age of that people. No sign whatever
is seen of the works of the Byzantines or Christians.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘To lay down a plan of the town is impossible, the
whole being concealed by trees; but walls of the finest
kind, Cyclopean blended with the Greek, as well as the
beautifully squared stones of a lighter kind, are seen in
every direction; several gateways also, with their paved
roads, still exist. I observed on my first visit that the
temples have been very numerous, and, from their position
along the brow of the cliff, must have combined with nature
to form one of the most beautiful of cities. The extent I
now find is much greater than I had imagined, and its
tombs extend over miles of country I had not before seen.
The beautiful gothic-formed sarcophagus-tomb, with chariots
and horses upon its roof, of which I have before
spoken and have given a sketch of a battle-scene upon the
side, accompanied with a Lycian inscription, is again a
chief object of my admiration amidst the ruins of this city.
Of the ends of this monument I did not before show
drawings, but gave a full description. Beneath the rocks,
at the back of the city, is a sarcophagus of the same kind,
and almost as beautifully sculptured; but this has been
thrown down, and the lid now lies half-buried in the earth.
Its hog’s-mane is sculptured with a spirited battle-scene.
Many Greek inscriptions upon pedestals are built into the
walls, which may throw some light upon the history of the
city; they are mostly funereal, and belong to an age and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_648'>648</span>people quite distinct from those of the many fine Lycian
remains.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Two of my days have been spent in the tedious, but, I
trust, useful occupation, of copying the Lycian inscription
from the obelisk I mentioned in my former volume that
I had seen: this will be of service to the philologist.
Having, with the assistance of a ladder, ascended to a level
with the top of the monument, I discovered a curious fact:
the characters cut upon the upper portion are larger and
wider apart than those on the lower, thus counteracting the
effect of diminution by distance, as seen from the ground.
As the letters are beautifully cut, I have taken several impressions
from them, to obtain fac-similes. By this inscription
I hope to fix the type of an alphabet, which will
be much simplified, as I find upon the various tombs about
the town great varieties, though of a trifling nature, in the
forms of each letter; these varieties have hitherto been
considered as different characters. This long public inscription
will establish the form of all the letters of an
alphabet, one form only being used throughout for each
letter: if this should be deciphered, it may be the means
of adding information to history. The inscription exceeds
two hundred and fifty lines.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It is to be regretted that the obelisk is not perfect;
time or an earthquake has split off the upper part, which
lies at its foot. Two sides of this portion only remain,
with inscriptions which I could copy; the upper surface
being without any, and the lower facing the ground: its
weight of many tons rendered it immoveable. I had the
earth excavated from the obelisk itself, and came to the
base, or probably the upper part of a flight of steps, as in
the other obelisk-monuments of a similar construction.
The characters upon the north-west side are cut in a finer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_649'>649</span>and bolder style than on the others, and appear to be the
most ancient. Should any difference of date occur on this
monument, I should decide that this is the commencement
or original inscription upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘This, which I must consider as a very important monument,
appears to have on the north-east side a portion of
its inscription in the early Greek language; the letters are
comparatively ill cut, and extremely difficult at such an
elevation to decipher; seizing favourable opportunities for
the light, I have done my best to copy it faithfully, and
glean from it that the subject is funereal, and that it relates
to a king of Lycia; the mode of inscription makes the
monument itself speak, being written in the first person.
Very near to this stands the monument, similar in form,
which I described in my last Journal as being near the
theatre, and upon which remained the singular bas-reliefs
of which I gave sketches.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Journal of an
Excursion in
Asia Minor</cite>,
&amp;c. (2nd
Edit.),
Appendix.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On closer examination I find
these to be far more interesting and ancient than I had
before deemed them. They are in very low-relief, resembling
in that respect the Persepolitan or Egyptian bas-reliefs.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘I have received,’ continues Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span>, ‘from
Mr. Benjamin <span class='sc'>Gibson</span> of Rome a letter in reference to these
bas-reliefs: his interpretation of this mysterious subject
appears far the best that I have yet heard; and from finding
the district to have been in all probability the burial-place
of the kings, it becomes the more interesting. Mr. <span class='sc'>Gibson</span>
writes—“The winged figures on the corners of the tomb
you have discovered in Lycia, represented flying away
with children, may with every probability be well supposed
to have a reference to the story of the Harpies flying away
with the daughters of King <span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>. This fable we find
related by <span class='sc'>Homer</span> in the <cite>Odyssey</cite>, lib. xx, where they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_650'>650</span>stated to be left orphans, and the gods as endowing them
with various gifts. Juno gives them prudence, Minerva
instructs them in the art of the loom, Diana confers on
them tallness of person, and lastly Venus flies up to Jupiter
to provide becoming husbands for them; in the mean time,
the orphans being thus left unprotected, the Harpies come
and ‘snatch the unguarded charge away.’ <span class='sc'>Strabo</span> tells us
that <span class='sc'>Pandarus</span> was King of Lycia, and was worshipped
particularly at Pinara. This tomb becomes thus very interesting;
which, if it be not the tomb of <span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>, shows
that the story was prevalent in Lycia, and that the great
author of the <cite>Iliad</cite> derived it from that source. With
this clue, we have no difficulty in recognising Juno on
the peculiar chair assigned to that goddess, and on the
same side is Venus and her attendants; upon another
is probably represented Diana, recognised by the hound.
The seated gods are less easily distinguished. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Travels and
Researches in

In the
Harpies, at the four corners of the tomb, we have the
illustration of those beings as described by the classic
writers.”’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Many subsequent discoveries; (the details here necessarily passed over).</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Every lateral excursion made by Sir C. <span class='sc'>Fellows</span>, and by
his companions in travel, added to his collection rich works
of sculpture, and not a few of them added many varied and
most interesting minor antiquities. But I must needs
resist all temptation to enlarge on that head, though the
temptation is great. The twentieth and subsequent chapters
of the book itself (I refer to the <em>collective</em> but abridged
‘<cite>Travels and Researches in Asia Minor</cite>’ of 1852) will
abundantly repay the reader who is disposed to turn to
them—whether it be for a renewed or for a new reading.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the task of removal had to be undertaken, difficulties

The maritime part of the duty had been entrusted to
Captain <span class='sc'>Graves</span>, of H.M. Ship <em>Beacon</em>. The captain left

<p class='c011'>He took a solitary walk of many hours, he tells us, before
he could resolve upon his course of action. He saw before
him, to use his own words, ‘a mine of treasure.’ He had
willing hands to work it; ample firmans to stave off opposition;
nothing deficient save boats and tackle. A year
might possibly pass in awaiting them from Malta; and,
meanwhile, the ignorance of the peasantry, the indiscreet
curiosity of travellers, or the sudden growth of political
complications, might destroy the enterprise irrecoverably.</p>

<p class='c011'>He resolved, in his perplexity, to construct by his own
exertions tackle that would suffice for the removal to the
coast; got native help in addition to the willing efforts—however
unscientific—of the honest sailors of the <em>Beacon</em>;
succeeded in getting a portion of the precious objects of his
quest to the waterside, before the arrival of the ship; and
got them also strongly cased up. Then he sailed with
<span class='sc'>Graves</span> for Malta. The worthy captain resigned the
honourable task—to him so unwelcome—into the hands of
Admiral Sir Edward <span class='sc'>Owen</span>. A new expedition started
from Malta at the end of April, and brought away seventy-eight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_652'>652</span>cases of sculpture in June; leaving the splendid but
too heavy ‘winged-chariot-tomb’—so called by its discoverer
in one place, and elsewhere called ‘horse-tomb,’
but since ascertained to be the tomb of a Lycian satrap
named <span class='sc'>Paiafa</span>; <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Arrival in

it is adorned with figures of Glaucus, or
perhaps of Sarpedon, in a four-horse chariot—until next
year. The seventy-eight cases were brought to England
by the Queen’s ship <em>Cambridge</em> in the following December.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the fourteenth of May, 1842, the Trustees of the
British Museum thus recorded their sense of Mr. <span class='sc'>Fellows’</span>
public services:—‘The Trustees desire to express their
sense of Mr. <span class='sc'>Fellows’</span> public spirit, in voluntarily undertaking
to lend to so distant an expedition the assistance
of his local knowledge and personal co-operation.
They have viewed with great satisfaction the decision and
energy evinced by Mr. <span class='sc'>Fellows</span> in proceeding from Smyrna
to Constantinople, and obtaining the necessary authority
for the removal of the marbles; as well as his judicious
directions at Xanthus, by which the most desirable of the
valuable monuments of antiquity formerly brought to light
by him, together with several others, of scarcely less
interest,

now for the first time discovered and excavated,
have been placed in safety, and—as the Trustees
have every reason to hope—secured for the National
Museum.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This hope was more than realised. It shows the energy
of <span class='sc'>Fellows</span>, that the expedition to Lycia of 1841 was his
<em>third</em> expedition. In 1846 he made a fourth. It was rich
in discovery; but I fear somewhat exhausting to the strength
of the explorer. He lived a good many years, it is true,
after his return to England; but how easily he yielded when
a sudden attack of illness came, I shall have the pain of
showing presently.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_653'>653</span>In the interval between his third and fourth journeys to
Lycia, <span class='sc'>Fellows</span> married a fellow-townswoman, Mary, the
only daughter of Francis <span class='sc'>Hart</span>, of Nottingham, but she
survived the marriage only two years. A year after her
death he married the widow of William <span class='sc'>Knight</span>, of Oatlands,
in Herts. On his final return from Lycia he was
knighted, as a token (and it was but a slender one) of the
public gratitude for his services. At the close of October,
1860, a sudden attack of pleurisy invaded a toilworn frame.
On the eighth of the following month he died, at his house
in Montagu Place, London, in the sixty-first year of his
age.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Date and character of the monuments in the ‘Lycian Gallery.’</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Taken broadly, the sculptures of Lycia may be described
as works which range, in date, from the sixth century before
our Lord to almost as many centuries—if we take the
minor antiquities into account—after the commencement of
the Christian era. Some of them rank, therefore, amongst
the earliest <em>original</em> monuments of Greek art which the
British Museum possesses; and date immediately after the
<em>casts</em> of the sculptures of Selinus and of Ægina.</p>

<p class='c011'>On some of the myths and on the habits of Lycian life
there has been a sharp controversy, of the merits of which I
am very incompetent to speak. Narrower and narrower as
my limits are becoming, I yet feel it due to a public benefactor,
who can no longer speak for himself otherwise than
by his works, that in these waning pages he should be permitted
to supply at least a part of his own explanatory
comments upon the story of his discoveries. It is one of
enchaining interest to the students of classical antiquity.</p>

<p class='c011'>The famous ‘Harpy Tomb,’ thinks Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span>,
is to be enumerated as among the most ancient of the remaining
works of the ‘Tramilæ,’ or ‘Termilæ,’ mentioned both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_654'>654</span>by <span class='sc'>Herodotus</span> and by <span class='sc'>Stephen</span> of Byzantium, as well as
on the Xanthian obelisk or <em>stele</em>, now called the ‘Inscribed
Monument,’ and numbered ‘141’ in the Lycian Gallery of
the Museum.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Fellows’ account of the Lycian Marbles.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Sir Charles <span class='sc'>Fellows</span> proceeds to say that ‘the shaft,
frieze, and cap of this monument, weighing more than
a hundred tons, has been by an earthquake moved upon
its pedestal eighteen inches towards the north-east,
throwing to the ground two stones of the frieze towards
the south-west: in this state I found it in 1838. In 1841
the eight stones of this frieze were placed in the Museum.
The only similar art which I know in Europe is in the
Albani Villa near Rome. This slab is described by
<span class='sc'>Winckelmann</span> as being of earlier workmanship than that
of Etruria. I shall not dwell upon these works, as they
were found <em>in sitû</em>, and will therefore be as well understood
in England as if seen at Xanthus. I may draw attention
to the blue, red, and other colours still remaining upon
them. The subject also being that of the family of King
<span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>, it should ever be borne in mind that this monument
stood in the metropolis of Lycia, and within twelve
miles of the city of Pinara, where we are told that <span class='sc'>Pandarus</span>
was deified. This and the neighbouring tombs stood there
prior to the building of the theatre, which is probably of
Greek workmanship. The usual form of this structure
must have been partially sacrificed on account of these
monuments, as the seats rising in the circles above the
diazoma have abruptly ceased on the western side, and have
not been continued towards the proscenium. Near to one
of the vomitories in the south-eastern bend of the diazoma
is a similar monument to the Harpy Tomb, which has had
the capstone and bas-reliefs removed, and the shaft built
over by the theatre. Upon one of its sides is a short Lycian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_655'>655</span>inscription, and a few words referring to its repair remain
upon another side in the Greek character.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Not far from these stands the inscribed stele, which is of
the highest interest; of this, which is too heavy and too much
mutilated to allow, without great labour, of its removal to
the Museum, I have had casts taken in plaster. From my
publications you would learn that a portion of the top of
this [monument], weighing several tons, had been split off
by the shocks of earthquakes: of this I have also had casts
taken. In excavating around the monument on the south-west,
and in the opposite direction to which the top had
split off, I found the capstone had been thrown which had
surmounted bas-reliefs; also two fragments of a bas-relief,
but I think too high to have been placed upon this stele:
they are the work of the same age, and are now placed in
the Museum. The most important discovery here was of
the upper angles broken from the monument, and having
upon them the inscription on each side, thus perfecting, as
far as they extend, the beginnings and ends of the upper
lines of the inscription; these original stones I have brought
home, being useless and insecure, if left in fragments with
the monument. The exact form of the letters of the
Greek portion of this inscription, compared with many
others of which I shall speak, will do much to fix a date
to these works.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Upon the point of rock on the north-west side of the
Acropolis is a fine Cyclopean basement, which has probably
been surmounted by a similar monument to those of which
I have spoken. No trace is found of any of its fragments;
and from its position, shocks in the same direction as those
which have destroyed the others would have thrown this
down the perpendicular cliff into the river which flows
about three hundred feet beneath.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_656'>656</span>‘The masses of Cyclopean foundations traced around and
upon the Acropolis, have been too much worked in, and
converted to the use of an after people to ascertain their
original form: they certainly have not been continuous,
forming a wall or defence for the Acropolis; indeed, its
natural position would render this superfluous, the cliffs on
the south and west are inaccessible. I observe that most
of the forms are referable to vast pedestals or stoas for
large monuments; and from their individual positions at
various elevations, and upon angles and points, I believe
that the Acropolis has been covered with the ornamented
monuments of this early people. The walls and basements
of these separate buildings have since been united by strong
lines formed of the old materials, the most ready for the
purpose, and all put together with a very excellent cement,
of which I have brought away specimens. A wall of this
formation, facing the south-west, attracted my attention in
1838, by displaying some sculptured animals and chariots
built as material into its front. This wall we have,
with great labour, owing to the hardness of the cement,
entirely removed; behind a portion of it we found a fine
Cyclopean wall, which had slightly inclined over from the
weight of earth behind; the casing which we have removed
strengthened it, and, connecting the old buildings
with others, formed a line of fortification, probably in
Roman times. From the great size of the blocks used in
constructing this wall, from the similarity of the stone, as
well as from the sculpture traceable upon almost the whole
of them, I conclude that they must have been the ruins of
monuments in the immediate neighbourhood; basements
for such are on either side. The works found here
are entirely those of the early people; and I may
extend this remark to all found upon the Acropolis. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_657'>657</span>architectural fragments, many specimens of which I bring
away, are all Lycian, and would form monuments imitative
of wooden constructions—beam-ends, ties, mortices, and
cornices, similar to the tombs shown in the drawings, but
double the size in point of scale to any now existing;
bearing this in mind, I do not think it improbable that the
sculptures representing a chariot procession have filled the
panels on either side; should this be the case we have
nearly the whole complete. The cornice and borders of
these strongly corroborate this idea. We have four somewhat
triangular stones, with sitting sphinxes upon each;
these would complete the two gable ends in similar form
and spirit of device to the generality of the tombs of this
people. There is also an angle-stone, interesting from its
sculpture, and from its style and subject blending these
works with the age of the “Harpy Tomb.”</p>

<p class='c011'>‘To continue with the works of the early inhabitants:
We must next notice the tombs at the foot of the rocky
heights at the south-eastern parts of the city: of these
the most beautiful are the kind having Gothic-formed tops;
these can be seen in the various drawings. The structure
generally consists of a base or pedestal which has contained
bodies, the <em>Platas</em>, surmounted by a plinth or solid
mass of stone, which is often sculptured; above this is a
sarcophagus, generally imitative of a wood-formed cabinet,
the principal receptacle for the bodies, the <em>Soros</em>; upon
this is placed a Gothic lid, sometimes highly ornamented
with sculpture, which also served as a place of sepulture,
probably the <em>Isostæ</em>. From one of these, in which the
lower parts were cut out of the solid rock, and the top had
fallen and been destroyed, I have had casts taken, as the
subject is intimately connected with the frieze of the wild
animals on the Acropolis. On this tomb, the inscription
<span class='pageno' id='Page_658'>658</span>is cut in the language of the early people. Not far distant
from this is a tomb which, from the sculpture upon it, I
distinguish as the “Chimæra-Tomb.” The lid of this,
which I found in 1840, is perfect, but had been thrown to
the ground by the effect of earthquakes; the chamber
from off which it had slidden was inclining towards the lid;
beneath the chamber a few stones forming the foundation
and step (in the same block) are alone to be found. There
is here no trace of the first two stories, and from the rock
approaching the surface of the ground I found no depth
of earth for research. Upon the chamber of this tomb is
a Lycian inscription, of which I have casts, in order that
they may be used in reconstructing the monument in the
Museum. The other tomb of this character, and by far
the most highly ornamented, was the tomb of <span class='sc'>Paiafa</span>, and
I call it, from its sculpture, the “Winged-Chariot-Tomb.”
In finding this monument, in 1838, I observed that each
part had been much shaken and split by earthquake, but
no portion was wanting except a fragment from the north
corner. This monument combines matters of great interest,
showing in itself specimens of the architecture,
sculpture, and language. I have stated that this style of
monument is peculiar to Lycia; and I now add, from the
knowledge derived from my research in that country, that
Lycia contains none but these two of this ornamental description.
These differ in minor points, making the possession
of each highly desirable, and I am glad that these
will be placed in our National Museum. The tombs of
Telmessus, Antiphellus, and Limyra, are similar in construction,
but have not the sculptured tops and other ornamental
finishings seen in these.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Upon the Acropolis, and fallen into a bath, we found a
pedestal having sculptured upon the side a god and goddess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_659'>659</span>within a temple, in excellent preservation. On the opposite
side of the pedestal is a very singular subject, which,
had not certain points both of execution, material, and
position occurred, I should have attributed to the Byzantine
age. Amongst many other animals, the object of chase
to a hunter is seen much mutilated: this may have been
the representation of a novel idea of the Chimæra: the
hind quarters of a goat remain, with a snake for its tail.
It is greatly to be regretted that the other fragments could
not be found. On observing in the ground some very
ancient forms of the Greek letters, differing from all others
found so commonly here, cut upon a slab of marble, I had
it taken up, and was delighted to find that it was a pedestal,
with a Lycian inscription upon the other side; this will be
valuable, as showing the form of the Greek characters in
use at the age of the language of Lycia. This same type
is seen in all the bilingual inscriptions, of which we have
only casts.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of another pedestal at Tlos I have taken casts, which will
be valued from the subjects of the bas-reliefs. The pedestal
of one stone was formed of two cubes, a small one upon
a larger. The fourth side of the upper one was not sculptured.
One slab of the larger cube represents in bas-relief
a view of the Acropolis of Tlos, the Troas of these
early people: probably the hero whose deeds were by this
monument commemorated, and whose name occurs twice
upon it, was engaged in the defence or capture of the
city. At Tlos I also found cut in the rock of the Acropolis
a tomb with an Ionic portico.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><em>Note.</em>—The
plans referred
to are
appended to
the first
edition of Sir
C. Fellows’
book.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Within this are represented
a panelled and ornamented door, and several
sculptured devices and animals, as shown in the drawings
and plans. On the side, and within the portico, is a very
early bas-relief of Bellerophon upon Pegasus, and probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_660'>660</span>a chimæra beneath the horse; but this portion of the sculpture
is unfinished, and the rock beneath is left rough; the
columns of the portico are only blocked out from the rock.
Of the bas-relief of Bellerophon I have casts, and the full
detail of the colouring which now remains upon the figures.
This is probably the earliest sculpture which we have obtained.
From Cadyanda I have casts of parts of a beautiful
tomb, which is so much in ruins, and shaken into fragments,
that I could not even take casts of the whole of the
sculptures that remain. The roof or lid is wanting. The
tomb now consists of a chamber in imitation of a wooden
structure, and in the panels is sculpture; surmounting this
is a smaller solid block, or plinth, also sculptured, but the
upper part is wanting. These bas-reliefs, of which I show
many drawings in my ‘Lycia,’ derive great additional interest
from several of the figures having near them names inscribed
in two languages—the Greek and the Lycian. The
casts of these, I doubt not, will be valued as important illustrations.
From Myra I have casts of the whole of the
figures ornamenting one of the rock-tombs. Three of
these subjects from within the Portico retain so much of
their original painting that I have had the casts coloured
on the spot as fac-similes, and a portion of the paint is
preserved for chemical examination. There are from this
tomb eleven figures the size of life. Of the inscriptions of
this people I have made many copies; I have had casts of
one long one from the large Gothic-formed tomb at Antiphellus,
also of the bilingual inscription from the same
place, and of another from Levisse, near the ancient
Telmessus.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of the age of the next works of which I must speak,
and which are a large portion of the collection from Xanthus,
I have great difficulty in forming an opinion. The whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_661'>661</span>were found around a basement which stands on the edge of a
cliff to the south-east of the ancient Acropolis. The monument
which stood upon this stoa has been thrown down by
earthquake, almost the whole of its ruins falling towards
the north-west. These works are of a people quite distinct
from the preceding, both in their architecture, sculpture,
and language: these are purely Greek. On carefully examining
the whole of the architectural members of which
I have specimens selected (some retaining coloured patterns
upon them), as well as the position in which each of the
various parts were thrown, I have, in my own mind, reconstructed
the building, the whole of which was of Parian
marble, and highly finished. The monument which I suppose
to have crowned this basement has been either a magnificent
tomb, or a monument erected as a memorial of a
great victory. In reforming this, I require the whole of the
parts that we have found, and none are wanting except two
stones of the larger frieze, and the fragments of the statues.
The art of this sculpture is Greek, but the subjects show
many peculiarities and links to the earlier works found in
Lycia. The frieze, representing the taking refuge within a
city, and the sally out of its walls upon the besiegers, has
many points of this character. The city represented is an
ancient Lycian city, and has within its walls the stele, or
monument known alone in Xanthus. The city is upon a
rock; women are seen upon the walls. The costume of
the men is a longer and thinner garment than is seen in
the Attic Greeks. The shields of the chiefs are curtained.
The saddle-cloth of the jaded horse entering the city is
precisely like the one upon the Pegasus of Bellerophon,
and the conqueror and judge is an Eastern chief, with the
umbrella, the emblem of Oriental royalty, held over him.
The body-guard and conquering party of the chief are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_662'>662</span>Greek soldiers. Many of these peculiarities are also seen
in the larger frieze, and also in the style of the lions and
statues. The form of the building, which alone I can
reconcile with the remains, is a Carian monument of the
Ionic order. Bearing in mind all these points, I am strongly
inclined to attribute this work to the mercenaries from
Æolia and Ionia, brought down by <span class='sc'>Harpagus</span> to conquer
the inhabitants of Xanthus, whom they are said to have
utterly destroyed. This monument may have been the
tomb of a chief, or erected as a memorial of the conquest
of the city by <span class='sc'>Harpagus</span>. No inscription has been found,
or it might probably have thrown some light upon the
date of this work. In the immediate neighbourhood were
found the other friezes, representing hunting-scenes, a
battle, offerings of various kinds and by different nations,
funeral feasts, and several statues which are of the same
date.’ Sir Charles then concludes thus:—</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The whole of the remaining works now to be traced
amidst the ruins of Xanthus are decidedly of a late date;
scarcely any are to be attributed to a period preceding the
Christian era, and to that age I cannot conceive the works
just noticed to have belonged. A triumphal arch or gateway
of the city at the foot of the cliff of which I have
spoken has upon it a Greek inscription, showing it to have
been erected in the reign of <span class='sc'>Vespasian</span>, <em>A.D.</em> 80: from this
arch are the metopes and triglyphs now in the Museum.

Researches in
Asia Minor</cite>,
pp. 429, 430
(1852).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Through this is a pavement of flagstones leading towards
the theatre. To this age I should attribute the theatre,
agora, and most of the buildings which I have called Greek,
and which are marked red upon the plan. To this people
belong the immense quantity of mosaic pavements which
have existed in all parts of the city. Almost all the small
pebbles in the fields are the débris of these works. In many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_663'>663</span>places we have found patterns remaining which are of
coarse execution, but Greek in design.’</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Marbles of Halicarnassus, of Cnidus, and of Branchidæ.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The not a whit less interesting discoveries at Halicarnassus
and elsewhere, made chiefly in the years 1856,
1857, and 1858, by Mr. Charles <span class='sc'>Newton</span>, now claim
attention, but my present notice of them can be but very
inadequate to the worth of the subject. They as richly
deserve a full record as do the explorations of <span class='sc'>Layard</span> or
those of <span class='sc'>Fellows</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>The earliest, in arrival, of the Halicarnassian Marbles
were procured by our Ambassador at Constantinople
(then Sir Stratford <span class='sc'>Canning</span>, now) Lord <span class='sc'>Stratford de
Redcliffe</span>. These first-received marbles comprise twelve
slabs, sculptured with the combats of Greeks and Amazons
in low-relief; and were removed from the walls of the
mediæval castle of Budrum, in the year 1846, with the
permission, of course, of the Sublime Porte. It is a tribute
all the stronger to the energy of Lord <span class='sc'>Stratford</span> to find
another man of energy writing, in 1841: ‘I would not have
been a party to the asking what—to all who have seen
them’ (namely, the Marbles of Halicarnassus, built into the
inner walls of Budrum Castle)—‘must be considered as an
unreasonable request.’

It took, it is true, five years for
Lord <span class='sc'>Stratford</span> to overcome the obstacle which to Mr.
<span class='sc'>Fellows</span> seemed, in 1841, quite insuperable.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The mission to the Levant of Mr. Charles Newton. 1856–58.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In 1856, and expressly in order to a thorough exploration
of the site of Halicarnassus, and of other promising
parts of the Levant, Mr. Charles <span class='sc'>Newton</span>, then one of
the ablest of the officers of the Department of Antiquities
(whose loss at the Museum, even for three or four years,
was not very easily replaceable), accepted the office of
British Vice-Consul at Mitylene. In 1857, he discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_664'>664</span>four additional slabs (similar to those received from the
Ambassador), on the site of the world-famous mausoleum
itself; several colossal statues, and portions of such;
together with a multitude of architectural fragments of
almost every conceivable kind; columns—mostly broken
into many portions—with their bases, capitals, and entablatures,
in sufficient quantity and diversity to warrant a
faithful restoration of the ancient building by a competent
hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>From Didyme (near Miletus), from Cnidus, and from
Branchidæ, many fine archaic figures in the round; some
colossal lions; and an enormous number of fragments both
of sculpture and of architecture; with many minor antiquities,
various in character and in material, were successively
sent to England. Mr. Charles <span class='sc'>Newton’s</span> narrative of
his adventures at Budrum, and at several of the other places
of his sojourn and excavations, is very graphic. Some portions
of it are worthy to be placed side by side with the
best chapters of the earlier narrative of the explorations and
travelling experiences of <span class='sc'>Layard</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of the most famous trophy of Mr. <span class='sc'>Newton’s</span> first mission
to the East—the mausoleum built by Queen <span class='sc'>Artemisia</span>—the
discoverer has himself more recently given this brief
and striking descriptive account:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>This monument, writes Mr. <span class='sc'>Newton</span>, in 1869, was
erected ‘to contain the remains of <span class='sc'>Mausolus</span>, Prince of
Caria, about <em>B.C.</em> 352. It consisted of a lofty basement,
on which stood an oblong Ionic edifice, surrounded by
thirty-six Ionic columns, and surmounted by a pyramid of
twenty-four steps.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Guide to the
Department
of Antiquities</cite>,
&amp;c.,
pp. 74, 75.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The whole structure, a hundred and
forty feet in height, was crowned by a chariot-group in
white marble, in which probably stood <span class='sc'>Mausolus</span> himself,
represented after his translation to the world of demigods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_665'>665</span>and heroes. The peristyle edifice which supported the
pyramids was encircled by a frieze, richly sculptured in high-relief,’
and so on. The frieze thus mentioned is that of
which the twelve slabs were, as already mentioned, given
by Lord <span class='sc'>Stratford de Redcliffe</span> in 1846, four exhumed
by <span class='sc'>Newton</span> himself in 1857, and one more purchased from
the Marchese <span class='sc'>Serra</span>, of Genoa, in 1865. This piecemeal
acquisition of the principal frieze, by dint of researches
spread over twenty years, is not the least curious of the facts
pertaining to the story. But the annals of the Museum
comprise ten or twelve similar instances of ultimate reunion,
after long scattering, of the parts of one whole. They tell of
manuscripts (made perfect after the lapse of a century, it
may be) as well as of sculptures, thus toilsomely recovered.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the Greco-Amazonian battle-frieze was not the only
frieze of the famous mausoleum. The external walls of the
‘cella’ had two other friezes, of which Mr. <span class='sc'>Newton</span> succeeded
in recovering several fragments, some of them of
much interest. And the mausoleum was profusely adorned
with sculptures in the round as well as with the richly
carved figures in relief, both high and low, which encircled
(in all probability) the very basement, as well as the peristyle
and the cella portions of this marvellous structure.
Lions in watchful attitudes (‘lions guardant,’ in heraldic
phrase) stood here and there, and the fragments of these
which have been recovered testify to their variety of scale,
as well as to their number. The names of five famous
sculptors of the later Athenian school—<span class='sc'>Scopas</span>, <span class='sc'>Leochares</span>,
<span class='sc'>Bryaxis</span>, <span class='sc'>Timotheus</span>, <span class='sc'>Pythios</span>—who were employed upon
the decoration of the tomb itself, or upon the chariot-group,
have been recorded, and it would seem that each of four of
these had one side of the tomb specially assigned to him.
‘The material of the sculpture was Parian marble, and the

<p class='c011'>While <span class='sc'>Layard</span> was unearthing Nineveh; <span class='sc'>Fellows</span>
bringing into the light of day the long-lost cities of Lycia;
and Charles <span class='sc'>Newton</span> restoring, before men’s eyes, this

known (in effect) only by dim memories and traditions;

Dr. Nathan <span class='sc'>Davis</span>, in his turn, was exhuming Carthage
and Utica. All these distinguished men were labouring,
in common, for the enrichment of our National Museum,
within a period of some twenty years. Three of them may
be said to have been busied (in one way or other) with
their self-denying tasks contemporaneously.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c013'><sup>[42]</sup></a> If we take
into the account the variety, as well as the intrinsic worth,
of the additions thus made to human knowledge; above all,
if we duly estimate the value of those links of connection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_667'>667</span>between things human and things divine, which are the
most essential characteristic of some of the best of these
acquisitions, it may well be said that the annals of no
museum in the world can boast of such an enrichment as
this, by the efforts of the travellers and the archæologists
of one generation. And all of these explorers are—in one
sense or other—Britons.</p>

<p class='c011'>On one incidental point, I have to express a hope that the
reader will pardon what he may be momentarily inclined to
think an over-iteration of remark. If I have really adverted
somewhat too frequently to the connection which many of
these rich archæological acquisitions, of 1842–1861, present
between the annals of man and the Book of <span class='sc'>God</span>, I have
this to plead, in extenuation: Certain writers pass over that
connection so hurriedly as almost to lose sight of it. And we
live in an age in which some of our own countrymen—some
of those among us to whom the Creator has been most
bounteous in the bestowal of the glorious gifts of mind and
genius—have even spoken of our best of all literary possessions
as ‘Jew-Records,’ and ‘Hebrew old-clothes.’ Those
particular expressions, indeed, were employed long before
the arrival of the Assyrian Marbles. But I think I have
seen them quoted since.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The spoils of Carthage and Utica.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Among the spoils of Carthage and of Utica which we owe
to Dr. Nathan <span class='sc'>Davis</span>, are many rich mosaic pavements, of
the second and third centuries of our era, and a multitude
of Phœnician and Carthaginian inscriptions, extending in
date over several centuries. And it must be added that
many of the antiquities, and more especially of the mosaics,
excavated under Dr. <span class='sc'>Davis’s</span> instructions at Utica, were
found to possess greater beauty, and a more varied interest,
than most of those which were disinterred by him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_668'>668</span>from amidst the ruins of Carthage. Many of these, like
some of the choice treasures of Nineveh, are, in a sense, still
buried—for want of room at the British Museum adequately
to display them. The reader may yet, but too
fitly, conceive of some of them as piteously crying out
(in 1870, as in 1860)—</p>

But the record must needs be a mere catalogue, not a

<p class='c011'>Foremost among the discoverers of valuable remains of
Greek antiquity, subsequent to most of those which have
now been detailed, are to be mentioned Mr. George <span class='sc'>Dennis</span>,
who explored Sicily in 1862 and subsequent years; and
Captain T. A. B. <span class='sc'>Spratt</span>, who travelled over Lycia and the

and co-operation of two able and estimable fellow-travellers,
Edward <span class='sc'>Forbes</span> and Edward Thomas <span class='sc'>Daniell</span>, both of
whom, like their honoured precursor in Lycian exploration,
have been many years lost to us.</p>

<p class='c011'>The antiquities collected in Sicily by <span class='sc'>Dennis</span>, at the
national cost, were chiefly from the tombs. They included
very many beautiful Greek vases, a collection of archaic
terracottas, and other minor antiquities.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c013'><sup>[43]</sup></a> Some of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_669'>669</span>marbles discovered by <span class='sc'>Spratt</span> are of the Macedonian period,

<p class='c011'>At Camerus and elsewhere, in the island of Rhodes, important
excavations were carried on by Messrs. <span class='sc'>Biliotti</span>

In the course of them nearly three hundred tombs
were opened, and many choicely painted fictile vases of the
best period of Greek ceramography were found. Those
researches at Rhodes were the work of the years 1862,
1863, and 1864. In 1865, the excavations at Halicarnassus
were resumed by order of the Trustees, and under
the direction of the same explorers, and with valuable
results. In 1864, an important purchase of Greek and
Roman statues, and of the sculptures from the Farnese Collection
at Rome, was made. In the following year came an
extensive series of antiquities from the famous Collection of
the late Count <span class='sc'>Pourtalès</span>. Of the precious objects obtained
by the researches of Mr. Consul <span class='sc'>Wood</span>, at Ephesus,
in the same and subsequent years, a brief notice will be

<p class='c009'><em>The</em> <span class='sc'>Grenvilles</span> <em>and their Influence on the Political Aspect
of the Georgian Reigns.—The Public and Literary
Life of the Right Honourable Thomas</em> <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>.—<em>History
of the</em> <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> <em>Library</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the singular fortune of Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> to
belong to a family which has given almost half a score of
ministers to England; to possess in himself large diplomatic
ability; and to have been gifted—his political opponents
themselves being judges—with considerable talents
for administration; and yet, in the course of a life protracted
to more than ninety years, to have been an <em>active</em>
diplomatist during less than one year, and to have been a
Minister of State less than half a year. It is true that he was
of that happy temperament which both enables and tempts
a man to carve out delightful occupation for himself. He
had, too, those rarely combined gifts of taste, fortune, and
public spirit, which inspire their possessor with the will,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_671'>671</span>and confer upon him the power, to make his personal enjoyments
largely contribute (both in his own time and after it)
to the enjoyments of his fellow-countrymen. It might be
true, therefore, to say that Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> was the
happier and the better for his exclusion, during almost
forty-nine-fiftieths of his long life, from the public service.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>What was
it that
kept
Thomas
Grenville
aloof from
political
office?</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But it can hardly be rash to say that England must needs
have been somewhat the worse for that exclusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nor was it altogether a self-imposed exclusion. There
was among its causes a curious conjunction of outward
accidents and of philosophic self-resignation to their results.
Untoward chances abroad twice broke off the foreign embassies
of this eminent man. Unforeseen political complications
amongst Whigs and semi-Whigs twice deprived him
of cabinet office at home. But, no doubt, neither shipwreck
at sea nor party intrigue on land would have been potent
enough to keep Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> out of high State employment,
but for the personal fastidiousness which withheld
him from stretching out his hand, with any eagerness, to
grasp it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The political influence of the Grenville Family; its duration and its peculiar characteristics.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>It would, perhaps, be hard to lay the finger on any one
family recorded in the ‘<cite>British Peerage</cite>’ which so long and
so largely influenced our political history, in the Georgian
era of it, as did that of <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>. During the century
(speaking roundly) which began with the suppression of the
Jacobite Rebellion of 1745, and ended with the Repeal of the
Corn Laws, <span class='sc'>Grenvilles</span> are continually prominent in every
important political struggle. The personal influence and
(for lack of a plainer word) the characteristic ‘idiosyncrasy’
of individual <span class='sc'>Grenvilles</span> notoriously shaped, or materially
helped to shape, several measures that have had world-wide
results. But perhaps the most curious feature in their
political history as a family is this: At almost every great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_672'>672</span>crisis in affairs one <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>, of ability and prominence,
is seen in tolerably active opposition to the rest of the
<span class='sc'>Grenvilles</span>. In the political history of the man who
forms the subject of this brief memoir the family peculiarity,
it will be seen, came out saliently.</p>

<p class='c010'>The political <span class='sc'>Grenvilles</span> were offshoots of an old stock
which, in the days of eld, were richer in gallant soldiers than
in peace-loving publicists. The old <span class='sc'>Grenvilles</span> dealt many
a shrewd swordthrust for England by land and by sea, in
the Tudor times, and earlier. The younger branch has been
rich in statesmen and rich in scholars. Not a few of them
have shone equally and at once in either path of labour.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Parentage and early life of Thomas Grenville.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> was the second son of the Minister
of <span class='sc'>George the Third</span>, George <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>,—himself the
second son of Richard <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>, of Wotton, and of Hester
<span class='sc'>Temple</span> (co-heiress of Richard <span class='sc'>Temple</span>, Lord Cobham, and
herself created Countess <span class='sc'>Temple</span> in 1749). He was born
on the thirty-first of December, 1755, and entered Parliament
soon after attaining his majority. In the House of
Commons he voted and acted as a follower of Lord <span class='sc'>Rockingham</span>
and a comrade of Charles <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, in opposition to the
other <span class='sc'>Grenvilles</span> and the ‘Grenvillite’ party. Had the
famous India Bill of <span class='sc'>Fox’s</span> ministry been carried into a law,
Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>, it was understood, would have been
the first Governor-General of India under its rule.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>His short diplomatic career.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>His first entrance into the diplomatic service was made in
1782. His mission was to Paris. Its purpose, to negotiate
with Benjamin <span class='sc'>Franklin</span> a treaty of peace with
America.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See above,
Book II,
Chap. III,
page 431.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The circumstances beneath the influence of
which it was undertaken I have had occasion to advert to,
already, in the notice of Lord <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span>. It is needless
to return to them now.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_673'>673</span>Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville’s</span> union in the double negotiation
with Mr. <span class='sc'>Oswald</span> (instructed by <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span>, it will be remembered,
as <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> was by <span class='sc'>Fox</span>) proved to be very
distasteful to him. From the beginning it boded ill to the
success of the mission. As early as the 4th of June, 1782,
we find Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> writing to <span class='sc'>Fox</span>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Mission
to
Paris,
1782–3.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
thus:—‘I entreat
you earnestly to see the impossibility of my assisting you
under this contrariety.... I cannot fight a daily battle
with Mr. <span class='sc'>Oswald</span> and his Secretary.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c013'><sup>[44]</sup></a>
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>T. Grenville

4th June,
1782.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It would be neither
for the advantage of the business, for your interest, or for
your credit or mine; and, even if it was, <em>I</em> could not do it.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The then existing arrangements of the Secretaryship of
State gave the control of a negotiation with <em>France</em> to one
Secretary, and of a negotiation with <em>America</em> to the other.
The reader has but to call to mind the well-known political
relationship between <span class='sc'>Fox</span> and <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> in 1782, to gain
a fully sufficient key to the consequent diplomatic relationship
between <span class='sc'>Oswald</span> and Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>, when thus
engaged in carrying on, abreast, a double mission at the
Court of Paris.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Comp. also
same to
same,
June 16.
(<cite>Court and
Cabinets</cite> of
Geo. III,
pp. 36–51.)<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
To add to the obvious embroilment, <span class='sc'>Oswald</span>
had shortly before received from Benjamin <span class='sc'>Franklin</span>
a suggestion that Britain should ‘spontaneously’ cede
Canada, in order to enable his astute countrymen at home
the better to compensate both the plundered Royalists and
those among the victorious opponents of those Royalists
who had, from time to time, sustained any damage at the
hands of the British armies.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most earnest entreaties, from many quarters, were
used to induce <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> to remain at Paris. His political
friends, and his family connections, were, on that point,
alike urgent. But all entreaties were in vain. When the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_674'>674</span>news reached him of Lord <span class='sc'>Rockingham’s</span> death, and of
the break-up in the Cabinet which followed, his decision
was, if possible, more decided. He still clave to <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, while
his brother, Lord <span class='sc'>Temple</span>, accepted from <span class='sc'>Shelburne</span> the
Lieutenancy of Ireland. A Lordship of the Treasury or
the Irish Secretaryship was by turns pressed upon Mr.
<span class='sc'>Grenville</span> by Lord <span class='sc'>Temple</span> with an earnestness which
may be called passionate. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Lord Temple
to T. Grenville,
12th
July.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘Let me hope,’ said he, ‘that
you will feel that satisfaction that every [other] member of
my family most earnestly feels at my acceptance of the
Lieutenancy of Ireland.... I conjure you, by everything
that you prize nearest and dearest to your heart; by the
joy I have ever felt in your welfare; by the interest I have
ever taken in your uneasiness; weigh well your determination;
it decides the complexion of my future hours....
I have staked my happiness upon this cast.’ The resolve
of Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> to adhere to the position he had
taken was the cause of a family estrangement which endured
for many years. But the more a reader, familiar
with the annals of the time (and especially if he be also
familiar with the personal history of Lord <span class='sc'>Temple</span> before
and after), may study Lord <span class='sc'>Temple’s</span> letters of 1782, the
less he is likely to wonder that the peculiar line of argument
they develope failed to attain the aim they had in
view. The vein that runs through them is plainly that of
personal ambition; not of an adherence—at any cost—to a
sincere conviction, whether right or wrong, of public duty.
Such a line of argument was, at no time, the line likely to
commend itself to Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>. Both his virtues,
and what by many politicians will be regarded as his weaknesses,
alike armed him against obvious appeals to mere
self-interest or self-aggrandisement.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_675'>675</span>One result—and the not unanticipated result—of the
family estrangement of 1782 was that, two years later, Mr.
<span class='sc'>Grenville</span> found himself to have no longer the command
of a seat in Parliament.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The withdrawal
from Parliament,
1784–90.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For four years to come he gave
most of his leisure to a pursuit which he loved much better—as
far as personal taste was concerned—namely, to the
resumption of his systematic studies in classical literature.
But in 1790 he was elected a burgess for the town of Aldborough.
Thenceforward, and for a good many years,
politics again shared his time with literature, and with
those social claims and duties to which no man of his day
was more keenly alive.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1795 a second diplomatic mission was offered to him,
and it was accepted. In the interval, another and more
lasting change had come across his career in Parliament.
He was one of the many ‘Foxites’ who utterly disapproved
the course which their old leader adopted in regard to the
French Revolution and to the rising passion to glorify and
to imitate it at home. To the ‘Man of the People’ (as he
was very fancifully called), the English countershock to the
French overturn was, in one sense, specially fatal. It
ripened peculiar, though hitherto in some degree latent,
weaknesses. And with these, when they became salient,
Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> had really as little fellow-feeling as had
Edmund <span class='sc'>Burke</span>. Alike both men now supported <span class='sc'>Pitt</span>,
with whom, as experience increased and judgment matured,
they both had always had intrinsically far more in
common. And among the results of the new political
relationships came a restoration of family harmony.
George <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> became <span class='sc'>Pitt’s</span> Foreign Secretary;
Thomas <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> became <span class='sc'>Pitt’s</span> Minister to the Court
of Berlin. One year later, he again sat in Parliament for
Buckingham.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_676'>676</span>The mission to Berlin was first impeded by a threatened
shipwreck among icebergs at sea, and, when that impediment
had been with difficulty overcome, the journey was
again and more seriously obstructed by an actual shipwreck
upon the coast of Flanders.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Mission
to
Berlin,
1795.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville’s</span> life was exposed
to imminent danger. After a desperate effort, he
succeeded in saving his despatches and in scrambling to
land. But he saved nothing else; and the inevitable delay
enabled the French Directory to send <span class='sc'>Sièyes</span> to Berlin, in
advance of the ambassador of Britain. The able and
versatile Frenchman made the best of his priority. Mr.
<span class='sc'>Grenville</span> was not found wanting in exertion, any more
than in ability. But in the then posture of affairs the
advantage in point of time, proved to be an advantage
which no skill of fence could afterwards recover. Hence
it was that the mission of 1795 became practically an abortive
mission. With it ended the ambassador’s diplomatic
career.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Cabinet of 1806.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Almost equally brief was his subsequent actively official
career in England. On the formation of Lord <span class='sc'>Grenville’s</span>
Cabinet (February, 1806), no office was taken by the Premier’s
next brother. But on the death of <span class='sc'>Fox</span>, six months
later, he became First Lord of the Admiralty. That office
he held until the formation of the Tory Government, in the
month of April, 1807. It was too brief a term to give him
any adequate opportunity of really evincing his administrative
powers. And during almost forty remaining years
of life he never took office again, contenting himself with
that now nominal function (conferred on him in the year
1800),
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The ‘Chief-Justiceship
in
Eyre,’
south of
Trent.
1800–1845.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
the ‘Chief-Justiceship in Eyre, to the south of the
river Trent,’ of the profits of which, as will be seen presently,
he made a noble use. That office in Eyre had once
been a function of real gravity and potency. It was still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_677'>677</span>a surviving link between the feudal England of the Henrys
and the Edwards, on the one hand, and the industrial
England of the Georges on the other. Under a king who
could govern, as well as reign, the ‘Chief-Justiceship in
Eyre’ might have shown itself, in one particular, to possess
a real and precious vitality still. By possibility, the sports
of twelfth century and chase-loving monarchs might have
been made to alleviate the toils, to brighten the leisure, and
to lengthen the lives, of nineteenth-century and hard-toiling
artisans. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Chief-Justiceship
in Eyre,
and what
might have
come of its
perpetuation.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For in exerting the still <em>legal</em> powers (long
dormant, but not abolished) of the forest justiceship, a
potent check might have been provided against the profligate,
although now common, abuse of the powers entrusted
by Parliament to the Board of Woods and Forests. No new
legislation was wanted to save many splendid tracts of forest
land (over which the Crown then—and as well in 1845, as
in 1800—possessed what might have been indestructible
‘forestal rights’), for public enjoyment for ever. Existing
laws would have sufficed. But no blame on this score lies
at the charge of the then Chief Justice in Eyre. Had
Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>, for example, ever conceived the idea of
using the Forest Laws to preserve for the English people,
we will say, Epping Forest, or any other like sylvan tract
on this side of Trent, as a ‘People’s Park’ for ever, he
would have been laughed at as a Quixote. If Parliament
in 1870 is fast becoming alive to the misconduct of those
‘Commissioners’ who have dealt with the Forestal rights
of the Crown exactly in the spirit of the pettiest of village
shopkeepers, rather than in the spirit of Ministers of State,
there was in Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville’s</span> time scarcely the faintest
whisper of any such conviction of public duty in regard to
that matter. Not one Member of Parliament, I think, had
ever (at that time) pointed out the gross hypocrisy, as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_678'>678</span>as the folly, of <em>selling</em> by the hands of one public board and
for a few pounds hundreds of acres of ancient and lovely
woodlands, and then presently <em>buying</em>, by the hands of
another public board, acres of dreary and almost unimprovable
barrenness by the expenditure of several thousands
of pounds, in order to provide new recreation grounds
for ‘public enjoyment!’</p>

<p class='c011'>Of that forestal Chief-Justiceship Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> was
the last holder. The office had been established by <span class='sc'>William
the Conqueror</span>. It was abolished by Queen
<span class='sc'>Victoria</span>. One of the chief pursuits of those forty years
of retirement which ensued to the founder of the Grenville
Library, upon the breaking up of the Grenville
Administration of 1806, was book-buying and book-reading.
‘A great part of my Library’—so wrote Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>,
in 1845—‘has been purchased by the profits of a
sinecure office given me by the Public.’ If that sinecure
was not and, under the then circumstances, could not have
been by its holder’s action or foresight, made the means of
preserving for public enjoyment such of the ancient forests
as, early in this century, were still intact in beauty, and
also lay near to crowded and more or less unhealthy towns,
it was at least made the means of giving to the nation a
garden for the mind. ‘I feel it,’ continued Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>,
in his document of 1845,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Will of the
Rt. Hon.
T. Grenville</cite>;
Oct., 1845.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘to be a debt and a duty that I
should acknowledge my obligation by giving the Library
so acquired to the <span class='sc'>British Museum</span> for the use of the
Public.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Mr. T. Grenville’s intercourse with, and esteem for, Sir A. Panizzi.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>I have had occasion, already, to mention that many years
before his death Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> formed a very high
estimate of the eminent attainments and still more eminent
public services of Sir A. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>. No man had a better
opportunity of knowing, intimately, the merits of the then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_679'>679</span>Assistant-Keeper of the printed portion of our National
Library. Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> showed his estimate in a conclusive
and very characteristic way. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Minutes of
Inquiry</cite>, &amp;c.,
1848, and
subsequent
years, pp. 141,
seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He had earnestly
supported (in the year 1835) the proposal of a Sub-committee
of Trustees that Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi’s</span> early services—more
especially in relation to the cataloguing of what are known,
at the Museum, as ‘the French Tracts,’ but also as to other
labours—should be substantially recognised by an improvement
of his salary. At a larger meeting, the recommendation
of the smaller sub-committee was cordially
adopted in the honorary point of view, but was set virtually
aside, in respect to the ‘honorarium,’ That latter step
Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> so resented that he rose from the table,
and never sat at a Trustee meeting again.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Minutes
of Evidence</cite>,
as above.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He many times
afterwards visited the Museum; and I well remember the
impression made upon my own mind by his noble appearance,
at almost ninety years of age, on one of the latest of
those visits—not very long before his death. But in the
Committee Room he never once sat, during the last eleven
years of his life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Circumstances which marked the Gift to the Nation of the Grenville Library.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The fact being so, Readers unfamiliar with the ‘blue-books’
will learn without surprise that a conversation
between Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> and Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, in Hamilton
Place, was the prelude to his noble public gift of 1846.
That conversation took place in the autumn of 1845.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Ibid.; and
comp. p. 780
of the
<cite>Minutes</cite>
of 1849.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He,
in the course of it, assured Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> (by that time at
the head of the Printed Book Department) of his settled
purpose, and evinced a desire that his Library should be
preserved apart from the mass of the National Collection.
He then remarked, ‘You will have a great many duplicate
books, and you will sell them,’ speaking in a tone of inquiry.
‘No,’ replied <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, the ‘Trustees will never sell books
that are given to them.’ Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> rejoined with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_680'>680</span>evident relief of mind, ‘Well, so much the better.’ Long
afterwards, when visiting Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> in his private study,
he asked the question—‘Where are you going to put my
books? I see your rooms are already full.’ He was taken
to the long, capacious, but certainly not very sightly, ‘slip,’
contrived by Sir R. <span class='sc'>Smirke</span> on the eastern outskirt of the
noble King’s Library. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See the
Plan, hereafter.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘Well,’ was the Keeper’s reply,
‘if we can’t do better, we will put them <em>here</em>; and, as you
see, my room is close by. Here, for a time, they will at
least be under my own eye,’ The good and generous book-lover
went away with a smile on his genial face, well assured
that his books would be gratefully cared for.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The reception at the Museum of the Grenville Collection.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> died on the 17th of December, 1846.
On the day of his death it chanced that the present writer
was engaged on a review-article about the history of the
Museum Library. Ere many days were past it was his
pleasant task to add a paragraph—the first that was written
on the subject—respecting the new gift to the Public.
But an accident delayed the publication of that article
until the following summer.</p>

<p class='c011'>Meanwhile, the final day of the reception of the books—a
dreary, snowy day of the close of February—was, to us
of the Museum Library, a sort of holiday within-doors.
Very little work was done that day; but many choice
rarities in literature, and some in art, were eagerly examined.
All who survive will remember it as I do. To
lovers of books, such a day was like a glimpse of summer
sunshine interposed in the thick of winter.</p>

<p class='c010'>To tell what little can here be told of the history and
character of the Grenville Library in other words than in
those well-considered and appropriate words which were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_681'>681</span>employed by the man who had had so much delightful
intercourse with the Collector himself, and to whom belongs
a part of the merit of the gift, would be an impertinence.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Panizzi’s
account of
some of the
choicest
books
in the
Grenville
Library.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In his report on the accessions of the year 1847, Mr.
<span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> wrote thus:—‘It would naturally be expected that
one of the editors of the “Adelphi <cite>Homer</cite>” would lose no
opportunity of collecting the best and rarest editions of the
Prince of Poets. <span class='sc'>Æsop</span>, a favourite author of Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>,
occurs in his Library in its rarest forms; there is no
doubt that the series of editions of this author in that
Library is unrivalled. The great admiration which Mr.
<span class='sc'>Grenville</span> felt for Cardinal <span class='sc'>Ximenes</span>, even more on account
of the splendid edition of the Polyglot <cite>Bible</cite> which that
prelate caused to be printed at Alcala, than of his public
character, made him look upon the acquisition of the <cite>Moschus</cite>,
a book of extreme rarity, as a piece of good fortune.
Among the extremely rare editions of the Latin Classics, in
which the Grenville Library abounds, the unique complete
copy of <span class='sc'>Azzoguidi’s</span> first edition of <cite>Ovid</cite> is a gem well
deserving particular notice, and was considered on the
whole, by Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> himself, the boast of his collection.
The Aldine <cite>Virgil</cite> of 1505, the rarest of the Aldine
editions of this poet, is the more welcome to the Museum
as it serves to supply a lacuna; the copy mentioned in the
Catalogue of the Royal Collection not having been transferred
to the National Library.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The rarest editions of English Poets claimed and obtained
the special attention of Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>. Hence we find
him possessing not only the first and second edition of
<span class='sc'>Chaucer’s</span> <cite>Canterbury Tales</cite> by <span class='sc'>Caxton</span>, but the only
copy known of an hitherto undiscovered edition of the same
work printed in 1498, by <span class='sc'>Wynkyn de Worde</span>. Of
<span class='sc'>Shakespeare’s</span> collected Dramatic Works, the Grenville
<span class='pageno' id='Page_682'>682</span>Library contains a copy of the first edition, which, if not
the finest known, is at all events surpassed by none. His
strong religious feelings and his sincere attachment to the
Established Church, as well as his knowledge and mastery
of the English language, concurred in making him eager to
possess the earliest as well as the rarest editions of the
translations of the Scriptures in the vernacular tongue. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Panizzi’s
<cite>Report</cite>, in
the <cite>Annual
Returns</cite> of
1847, passim.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He
succeeded to a great extent; but what deserves particular
mention is the only known fragment of the <cite>New Testament</cite>
in English, translated by <span class='sc'>Tyndale</span> and <span class='sc'>Roy</span>, which was in
the press of <span class='sc'>Quentell</span>, at Cologne, in 1525, when the translators
were obliged to interrupt the printing, and fly to
escape persecution.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The History of the British Empire, and whatever could
illustrate any of its different portions, were the subject of
Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville’s</span> unremitting research, and he allowed
nothing to escape him deserving to be preserved, however
rare and expensive. Hence his collection of works on the
Divorce of <span class='sc'>Henry VIII</span>; that of Voyages and Travels, either
by Englishmen, or to countries at some time more or less
connected with England, or possessed by her; that of contemporary
works on the gathering, advance, and defeat of
the “Invincible Armada;” and that of writings on Ireland;—are
more numerous, more valuable, and more
interesting, than in any other collection ever made by any
person on the same subjects. Among the Voyages and
Travels, the collections of <span class='sc'>De Bry</span> and <span class='sc'>Hulsius</span> are the
finest in the world; no other Library can boast of four such
fine books as the copies of <span class='sc'>Hariot’s</span> <cite>Virginia</cite>, in Latin,
German, French, and English, of the <span class='sc'>De Bry</span> series. And
it was fitting that in Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville’s</span> Library should be
found one of the only two copies known of the first edition
of this work, printed in London in 1588, wherein an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_683'>683</span>account is given of a colony which had been founded by his
family namesake. Sir Richard <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Conversant with the Language and Literature of Spain,
as well as with that of Italy, the works of imagination by
writers of those two countries are better represented in his
Library than in any other out of Spain and Italy; in some
branches better even than in any single Library in the
countries themselves. No Italian collection can boast of
such a splendid series of early editions of <span class='sc'>Ariosto’s</span> <cite>Orlando</cite>,
one of Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville’s</span> favourite authors, nor, indeed, of
such choice Romance Poems. The copy of the first edition
of <span class='sc'>Ariosto</span> is not to be matched for beauty; of that of Rome,
1533, even the existence was hitherto unknown. A perfect
copy of the first complete edition of the <cite>Morgante
Maggiore</cite>, of 1482, was also not known to exist before Mr.
<span class='sc'>Grenville</span> succeeded in procuring his. Among the
Spanish Romances, the copy of that of <cite>Tirant lo Blanch</cite>,
printed at Valencia, in 1490, is as fine, as clean, and as
white, as when it first issued from the press; and no second
copy of this edition of a work professedly translated from
English into Portuguese, and thence into Valencian, is
known to exist except in the Library of the Sapienza, at
Rome.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘But where there is nothing common, it is almost depreciating
a collection to enumerate a few articles as rare. It
is a marked feature of this Library, that Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span>
did not collect mere bibliographical rarities. He never
aimed at having a complete set of the editions from the
press of <span class='sc'>Caxton</span> or <span class='sc'>Aldus</span>; but <cite>Chaucer</cite> and <cite>Gower</cite> by
<span class='sc'>Caxton</span> were readily purchased, as well as other works
which were desirable on other accounts, besides that of
having issued from the press of that printer; and, when
possible, select copies were procured. Some of the rarest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_684'>684</span>and these the finest, Aldine editions were purchased by him,
for the same reasons. The <cite>Horæ</cite> in Greek, printed by
<span class='sc'>Aldus</span> in 16º, in 1497, is a volume which, from its language,
size, and rarity, is of the greatest importance for the
literary and religious history of the time when it was
printed. It is therefore in Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville’s</span> Library. The
<cite>Virgil</cite> of 1501 is not only an elegant book, but it is the first
book printed with that peculiar <em>Italic</em>, known as Aldine,
and the first volume which <span class='sc'>Aldus</span> printed, “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">forma enchiridii</span></i>,”
as he called it, being expressly adapted to give poor
scholars the means of purchasing for a small sum the works
of the classical writers. This also is, therefore, among
Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville’s</span> books; and of one of the two editions of
<cite>Virgil</cite>, both dated the same year, 1514, he purchased a
large paper copy, because it was the more correct of the
two.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘It was the merit of the work, the elegance of the volume,
the “genuine” condition of the copy, &amp;c., which together
determined Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville</span> to purchase books printed on
vellum, of which he collected nearly a hundred. He paid
a very large sum for a copy of the Furioso of 1532, not
because it was “on ugly vellum,” as he very properly designated
it, but because, knowing the importance of such an
edition of such a work, and never having succeeded in procuring
it on paper, he would rather have it on expensive
terms and “ugly vellum,” than not at all.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘By the bequest of Mr. <span class='sc'>Grenville’s</span> Library, the collection
of books printed on vellum now at the Museum, and comprising
those formerly presented by <span class='sc'>George II</span>, <span class='sc'>George III</span>,
and Mr. <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span>, is believed to surpass that of any other
National Library, except the King’s Library at Paris, of which
<span class='sc'>Van Praet</span> justly speaks with pride, and all foreign competent
and intelligent judges with envy and admiration. In justice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_685'>685</span>to the Grenville Library, the list of all its vellum books
ought to be here inserted. As this cannot be done, some
only of the most remarkable shall be mentioned. These
are—the Greek <cite>Anthology</cite> of 1494; the <cite>Book of Hawking</cite>
of <span class='sc'>Juliana Berners</span> of 1496; the first edition of the <cite>Bible</cite>,
known as the “Mazarine Bible,” printed at Mentz about
1454; the Aldine <cite>Dante</cite> of 1502; the first <cite>Rationale</cite> of <span class='sc'>Durandus</span>
of 1459; the first edition of <span class='sc'>Fisher</span> <cite>On the Psalms</cite>,
of 1508; the Aldine <cite>Horace</cite>, <cite>Juvenal</cite>, <cite>Martial</cite>, and <cite>Petrarca</cite>,
of 1501; the <cite>Livy</cite> of 1469; the <cite>Primer of Salisbury</cite>,
printed in Paris in 1531; the <cite>Psalter</cite> of 1457, which
supplies the place of the one now at Windsor, which belonged
to the Royal Collection before it was transferred to
the British Museum; the <cite>Sforziada</cite>, by <span class='sc'>Simoneta</span>, of 1490,
a most splendid volume even in so splendid a Library; the
<cite>Theuerdank</cite> of 1517; the <cite>Aulus Gellius</cite> and the <cite>Vitruvius</cite>
of Giunta, printed in 1515, &amp;c. &amp;c. Of this identical copy
of <cite>Vitruvius</cite>, formerly Mr. <span class='sc'>Dent’s</span>, the author of the <cite>Bibliographical
Decameron</cite> wrote, “Let the enthusiastic admirers
of a genuine vellum Junta—of the amplest size and in spotless
condition—resort to the choice cabinet of Mr. <span class='sc'>Dent</span>

<p class='c010'>No reader of this volume will, in the course of its
perusal, have become more sensible than is its author of a
want of due <em>proportion</em>, in those notices which have occasionally
been given of some eminent naturalists who have
conspicuously contributed to the public collections, as
compared with the notices of those many archæologists and
book-gatherers who, in common with the naturalists, have
been fellow-workers towards the building up of our National
Museum.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The inadequacy
of
the notices
of naturalists
in this
volume,
and its
cause.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I feel, too, that my own ignorance of natural
history is no excuse at all for so imperfect a filling-out of
the plan which the title-page itself of this volume implies.
I feel this all the more strongly, because I dissent entirely
from those views which tend to depreciate the importance of
the scientific collections, in order (very superfluously) to
enhance that of the literary and artistic collections. Far
from looking at the splendid Galleries of mammals, or of
birds, or of plants, as mere collections of ‘book-plates,’
gathered for the ‘illustration’ of the National Library, or
from sharing the opinion that the books and the antiquities,
alone, are ‘what may be called the permanent departments
of the British Museum’ (to quote, literally, the words of a
publication<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c013'><sup>[45]</sup></a> issued whilst this sheet is going to press,
words which seem somewhat rashly—considering whence
they come—to prejudge a question of national scope, and
one which it assuredly belongs alone <em>to Parliament</em> to settle),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_688'>688</span>I regard these scientific collections as possessing, in common
with the others, the highest educational value, and as also
possessing, even a little beyond some of the others, a special
claim, it may be, upon the respect of Englishmen.</p>

<p class='c011'>That speciality of claim seems to me to accrue from the
fact, that two of the early <span class='sc'>Founders</span>, and one of the most
conspicuous subsequent <span class='sc'>Benefactors</span> of the Museum, were
pre-eminently Naturalists. Such was <span class='sc'>Courten</span>. Such was
<span class='sc'>Sloane</span>. Such was Sir Joseph <span class='sc'>Banks</span>. I shall have erred
greatly in my estimate of the regard habitually paid by a
British Parliament to the memory of the eminent benefactors
of Britain, if, in the issue, it do not become apparent
that such a consideration as this will weigh heavily with
those who will shortly—and after due deliberation and
debate—have to decide pending questions in relation to
the enlargement and to the still further improvement of the
British Museum.</p>

<p class='c011'>Be that however as it ultimately shall prove to be, if the
Public should honour this volume with a favourable reception,
it will be its author’s endeavour (in a second
edition) to supplement, by the knowledge and co-operation
of others, the ignorance and the deficiencies of which he is
very conscious in himself.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The formation of the new department of British and Mediæval Antiquities.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In resuming the notices connected with the now truly
magnificent Collection of Antiquities, we have to glance
at the organizing of a new ‘Department’ in the Museum.
During at least two generations it has been, from time
to time, remarked—with some surprise as well as censure—that
the ‘British’ Museum contained no ‘British’
Antiquities. Sometimes this criticism has been put much
too strongly, as when, for example, one of the recent
biographers of <span class='sc'>Wedgwood</span> thus wrote (in 1866, but referring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_689'>689</span>also to a period then ninety years distant). ‘At that
date, <em>as at present</em>, everything native to the soil, or produced
by the races who had lived and died upon it, was
repudiated by those who were the rulers of the National
Collection.’ <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Meteyard,
<cite>Life of Josiah
Wedgwood</cite>,
vol. ii, p. 162.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
At that time, assuredly, there were already in
the Museum a good many British beasts, British birds, and
British books;—no inconsiderable part of the ‘productions’
of our soil and of the races born and nurtured
upon it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, within a few months after the appearance of the
criticism I have quoted, all ground for its repetition was
removed by the formation of the ‘Department of British
and Mediæval Antiquities and Ethnography.’ It is thus
organized, in six separate sections:—</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>§ I.</dt>
    <dd>British Antiquities anterior to the Roman period.
    </dd>
    <dt>II.</dt>
    <dd>Roman Antiquities found in Britain.
    </dd>
    <dt>III.</dt>
    <dd>Anglo-Saxon Antiquities.
    </dd>
    <dt>IV.</dt>
    <dd>Mediæval sculpture, carving, paintings, metal work, enamels, pottery, glass, stone ware; 
    and implements of various kinds, and of various material.
    </dd>
    <dt>V.</dt>
    <dd>Costumes, weapons, accoutrements, tools, furniture, industrial productions, &amp;c.—both 
    ancient and modern—of non-European races.
    </dd>
    <dt>VI.</dt>
    <dd>Pre-historic Antiquities.<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' style='text-decoration: none; 
    '><sup>[46]</sup></a>
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c011'>To the enrichment of the fourth section of this new
department of the Museum (in a small degree), as well as
(much more largely) to that of the Classical Collections, the
choice treasures gathered in France during two generations
by successive Dukes of <span class='sc'>Blacas</span> largely contributed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Blacas Museum and its founders, 1815–1860.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The first of these Dukes, Peter Lewis John Casimir de
<span class='sc'>Blacas</span>, was born at Aulps in the year 1770. He was of a
family which has been conspicuous in Provence from the beginning
of the Crusades. Attaining manhood just at the eve
of the Revolution, the Duke followed the French princes into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_690'>690</span>exile, and warmly attached himself to <span class='sc'>Lewis the Eighteenth</span>,
to whom, in after years, he became the minister of
predilection, as distinguished from that monarch’s many
ministers of constraint. He had, in his own day, the
reputation of being a courtier; but seems to have been, in
truth, an honest, frank, and outspeaking adviser. One
saying of his depicts quite plainly the nature of the man,
and also the nature of the work he had to do:—“If you want
to defend your Crown, you musn’t  run away from your
Kingdom.” Those words were spoken in 1815; and, as we
all know, were spoken in vain.</p>

<p class='c011'>A statesman of that stamp—one who does <em>not</em> watch and
chronicle the shiftings of popular opinion, in order to know
with certainty what are his own opinions, or in order to
shape his own political ‘principles’—rarely enjoys popularity.
<span class='sc'>De Blacas</span> became so little popular at home, that
the King was forced to send him, for many years, abroad.
At Rome, he negotiated the Concordat (1817–19); at
Naples, he advised an amnesty (1822), together with other
measures, some of which were too wise for the latitude. In
the interval between his two residences at the Court of
Naples, he took part in the Congress of Laybach.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Formation of the Blacas Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The opportunities afforded by diplomacy in Italy and in
other countries were turned to intellectual and archæological,
as well as to political, account. He imitated the
example of <span class='sc'>Hamilton</span> and of <span class='sc'>Elgin</span>, and that of a crowd
of his own countrymen, long anterior to either. Since his
son’s death, the British Museum has, by purchase, entered
into his archæological labours almost as largely—in their
way and measure—as it has inherited the treasures of its
own enlightened ambassadors at Naples and at Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Duke died at Goeritz in 1839. Nine years earlier,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_691'>691</span>he had advised <span class='sc'>Charles X</span> against the measures which
precipitated that king into ruin; and when the obstinate
monarch had to pay the sure penalty of neglecting good
advice, the giver of it voluntarily took his share of the
infliction. He offered to attend <span class='sc'>Charles</span> into exile in
1830, as he had attended him forty years before, when in
the flush of youth. He lies buried at the King’s feet, in
the Church of the Franciscans at Goeritz—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Character of the Blacas Collection.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The late Duke of <span class='sc'>Blacas</span> augmented his father’s collections
by many purchases of great extent and value. His
special predilection was for coins and gems. In that
department the combined museum of father and son soon
came to rank as the finest known collection, belonging to
an individual possessor. It includes seven hundred and
forty-eight ancient and classical cameos and intaglios, and
two hundred and three others which are either mediæval,
oriental, or modern. The most precious portion of the
<span class='sc'>Strozzi</span> cabinet passed into it, as did also a choice part of
the collections, respectively, of <span class='sc'>Barth</span> and of <span class='sc'>De la Turbie</span>.
The Blacas Museum is also eminently rich in vases and
paintings of various kinds; in sculptures, on every variety
of material; in terracottas, and in ancient glass. Its ‘silver
toilet service’ of a Christian Roman lady of the fifth century,
named <span class='sc'>Projecta</span>, has been made famous throughout
Europe by the descriptive accounts which have appeared
from the pen of <span class='sc'>Visconti</span> and from that of <span class='sc'>Labarte</span>. The
casket is richly chased with figure-subjects. Among them
are seen figures of Venus and Cupid; of the lady herself
and of her bridegroom, <span class='sc'>Secundus</span>. Roman bridesmaids, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_692'>692</span>indubitable flesh and blood, are mingled with the more
unsubstantial forms of Nereids, riding upon Tritons.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Hugh Cuming; his travels and his collections, in America and elsewhere, 1791.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Of the men devoted, in our own day, to the enchaining
pursuits of Natural History, few better deserve a competent
biographer than does Hugh <span class='sc'>Cuming</span>, whose career, in
its relation to the Museum history, has an additional interest
for us from the circumstance that his course in life was
partly shaped by his having attracted, in childhood, the
notice of another worthy naturalist and public benefactor,
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>See page 376.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Colonel George <span class='sc'>Montagu</span>, of Lackham.</p>

<p class='c011'>Young <span class='sc'>Cuming’s</span> childish fondness for picking up shells
and gathering plants attracted Colonel <span class='sc'>Montagu’s</span> notice
about the time that the boy was apprenticed to a sailmaker,
living not far from the boy’s native village, West Alvington,
in Devon. The elder naturalist fostered the nascent passion
of his young and humble imitator, and the trade of
sailmaking brought <span class='sc'>Cuming</span>, whilst still a boy, into contact
with sailors. The benevolent and Nature-loving Colonel
told the youngster some of the fairy tales of science; the
tars spun yarns for him about the marvels of foreign parts.
A few, and very few, years of work at his trade at home
were followed by a voyage to South America. At Valparaiso
he resumed his handicraft, but only as a step (by aid
of frugality and foresight) towards saving enough of money
to enable him to devote his whole being to conchology and
to botany. Seven years of work under this inspiring
ambition, seem to have enabled the man of five-and-thirty
to retire from business, and to build himself a yacht. But
his was to be no lounging yachtman’s life; it was rather
to resemble the life of an A.B. before the mast. The year
1827 was spent in toiling and dredging, to good purpose,
amongst the islands of the South Pacific. When he returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_693'>693</span>to Valparaiso, the retired sailmaker found that he
had won fame, as well as many precious rarities in conchology
and botany. The Chilian Government gave him
special privileges and useful credentials. He then devoted
two years to the thorough exploration of the coasts extending
from Chiloë to the Gulf of Conchagua. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Athenæum</cite>
of 1865;
<cite>Returns presented

Parliament</cite>,
v. y.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He botanized
in plains, marshes and woods; he turned over shingle, and
explored the crannies of the cliffs, with the patient endurance
of a Californian gold-digger, and was much happier
in his companions. In 1831, he returned to England, with
a modest but assured livelihood, and with inexhaustible
treasures in shells and plants, of which multitudes were
theretofore unseen and unknown in Europe.</p>

<p class='c011'>The year 1831 was a happy epoch for a conchologist.
The Zoological Society had just gained a firm footing.
<span class='sc'>Broderip</span> and <span class='sc'>Sowerby</span> were ready to exhibit and to
describe the rich shells of the Pacific. Richard <span class='sc'>Owen</span> was
eager to anatomize the molluscs, and to write their biography.
Some of the novelties brought over by <span class='sc'>Cuming</span>
in 1831 were still yielding new information thirty years
afterwards; probably are yielding it still.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1835, Mr. <span class='sc'>Cuming</span> returned to America. He devoted
four years to an exhaustive survey of the natural history—more
especially, but far from exclusively, the conchology
and the botany—of the Philippine group of islands, of
Malacca, Singapore, and St. Helena.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Cuming</span> was fitted for his work not more by his scientific
ardour and his patient toil-bearing, than by his amiable
character. He loved children. His manner was so attractive
to them that in some places to which he travelled a
schoolful of children were extemporised into botanic missionaries.
The joyous band would turn out for a holiday,
and would spend the whole of it in searching for the plants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_694'>694</span>the shells, and the insects, with the general forms and
appearances of which the promoter and rewarder of their
voluntary labours had previously familiarised them. He
returned to England with such a collection of shells as no
previous investigator had brought home; and with about
one hundred and thirty thousand specimens of dried plants,
besides many curious specimens in other departments.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>R. Owen, <cite>On a National Museum of Natural History</cite>, pp. 53, seqq.</div>

<p class='c011'>His collections had been a London marvel before he set
out on his third voyage of discovery. He then possessed,
I believe, almost sixteen thousand <em>species</em>, and they were
regarded as a near approximation to a perfect collection,
according to the knowledge of the time.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Comp. <cite>Athenæum</cite>
as
above, and
the Museum
returns of
1865 and
subsequent
years.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
If the writer of
the able notice of him which the <cite>Athenæum</cite> published
immediately after his death was rightly informed, <span class='sc'>Cuming</span>
nearly doubled that number by the results of his final voyage,
and by those of subsequent purchases made in Europe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very naturally, strenuous efforts were made to ensure
the perpetuity of this noble collection during its owner’s
lifetime. The history of those efforts still deserves to be
told, and for more than one reason. But it cannot be told
here. This inadequate notice of a most estimable man
must close with the few words which, three years ago,
closed Professor <span class='sc'>Owen’s</span> annual <cite>Report on the Progress of
the Zoological Portion of the British Museum</cite>. ‘The discoveries
and labours of Mr. Hugh <span class='sc'>Cuming</span>,’ he then wrote,
‘do honour to his country; the fruition of them by Naturalists
of all countries now depends mainly <em>on the acquisition
of the space required for the due arrangement, exhibition—facility
of access and comparison—of the rarities
which the Nation has acquired</em>.’ And then he adds a small
individual instance, as a passing illustration of the value of
Mr. <span class='sc'>Cuming’s</span> life-long pursuit—‘Among the choicer rarities,&#160;... brought from the Philippines in 1840, was a specimen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_695'>695</span>of siliceous sponge (described and figured in the <cite>Transactions
of the Zoological Society</cite>), known as <cite>Euplectella Aspergillum</cite>.’
Up to the date of Mr. <span class='sc'>Cuming’s</span> death (tenth
August, 1865), this specimen—of what, for non-zoological
readers, may be likened to a sort of coral of rare beauty—brought
over in 1840, was unique. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Transactions</cite>,
&amp;c., vol. iii,
p. 203.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In the year next after
the discoverer’s death, <em>many</em> fine and curious specimens
were sent from the Philippines. The solitary explorer of
1839 had at length been followed by a school of explorers.
Such men as <span class='sc'>Cuming</span> live after their death, and hence the
marvellous increase, within a very few years, in our knowledge
of Nature, and of <span class='sc'>God’s</span> bounty to the world he made.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>J. R. Chorley and his collection of the Spanish Poets and Dramatists.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>By a man who did but little in literature, although he
possessed attainments which, in some respects, seem to
have surpassed those of a good many men whose lucubrations
have had much publicity and vogue, a valuable addition
was made a few years ago, by bequest, to the Museum
Library, both in the printed and manuscript departments.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Will of
Mr. Rutter
Chorley</cite>, 1866.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Mr. John Rutter <span class='sc'>Chorley</span> had collected about two hundred
volumes of the Spanish poetry and drama, and had enriched
them with manuscript notes, bibliographical and critical.
He had also prepared chronological tables of the dramatists—writing
them in Spanish, of which he was a master—together
with an account of their respective works. He
had, I think, contemplated, at some future time, the preparation
of some such book on the Spanish theatre as that
published by Mr. <span class='sc'>Ticknor</span>, many years ago, on Spanish
literature at large. Whether the appearance of <span class='sc'>Ticknor’s</span>
valuable book deterred Mr. <span class='sc'>Chorley</span> from prosecuting his
purpose, I know not. Probably he was one of the many
men the very extent of whose knowledge inspires a fastidiousness
which prompts them to keep on increasing their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_696'>696</span>private store, and to defer, almost until death overtakes
them, the drawing from that store for the Public. If there
may really, by some dim possibility, have been here and
there an inglorious <span class='sc'>Hampden</span>, or a mute <span class='sc'>Shakespeare</span>, it is
very certain that there have been, in literary history and in
like departments of human study, many an unknown
<span class='sc'>Disraeli</span>, many a Tom <span class='sc'>Warton</span>, brimful of knowledge
about poets and poetry, who never could have lived long
enough to put to public use the materials he had laboriously
brought together.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>George Witt and his collections illustrative of the History of Superstitions.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Of another Collector, whose pursuits lay at an opposite
pole to those of Mr. <span class='sc'>Chorley</span>, it would not be edifying to
say very much in these pages. Some among the collections
illustrative of the history of obscure superstitions (to quote
the polite euphuism of one of the Museum <cite>Returns</cite> to
Parliament) partake, in a degree, of the peculiar associations
which connect themselves with the bare name of a place at
which some few of them were really found—that too famous
retreat of the Emperor <span class='sc'>Tiberius</span>. Others of them, however,
possess a real archæological value from a different
point of view. All, no doubt, are characteristically illustrative,
more or less, of the doings ‘in the dark places of the earth,’
and may point a moral, howsoever little fitted to adorn a tale.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mr. George <span class='sc'>Witt</span>, F.R.S., the collector of these curiosities
of human error, was a surgeon who had lived much in
Australia, and who, on his return from the Colonies, had
retired to a provincial town in England, where, at first, he
amused his leisure by gathering a small museum of natural
history. Of that collection I remember to have seen a
printed catalogue, but I imagine that he sold it in his lifetime,
as no part of his objects of natural history came, with
his other and much more eccentric museum, to the augmentation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_697'>697</span>of the public stores. Towards the close of his
life he lived in London, and used to amuse himself by
exhibiting, and by lecturing upon, what he regarded as the
more racy portion of his later collections. He chose (I am
told) the hour of eleven o’clock on Sunday morning for
such peculiar expositions, but I do not think that <em>these</em>
‘Sunday Lectures’ were regarded, either by the man who
gave them or by his auditors, as especially fitted for ‘the instruction
of the working classes.’</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Christy Museum and its founder’s history.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Of a very different calibre to Mr. George <span class='sc'>Witt</span> was the
donor of the noble Museum of Ethnography which, <em>for
want of room at Bloomsbury</em>, still occupies the late donor’s
dwelling-house, almost two miles off. It is not too much
to say of Henry <span class='sc'>Christy</span>, that he was both an illustrious
man of science and an eminent Christian. The man whose
fame as a searcher into antiquity is spread alike over Europe
and America, is also remembered in many Irish cabins as
one who was willing to spend, lavishly, his health and
strength, as well as his money, in lifting up, from squalid
beds of straw and filth, poor creatures stricken at once with
famine and with fever, and so stricken as sometimes to have
almost lost the semblance of humanity. He is also remembered
by Algerian peasants, by West African negroes, and
by Canadian Indians for like deeds of beneficence. When
Prussian insolence and Prussian barbarity struck down
Danes who were defending hearth and home, <span class='sc'>Christy</span> was
again the open-handed benefactor of the oppressed. When
Turks were, in like manner, beating down by sheer brute
force the Druses of Syria, Henry <span class='sc'>Christy</span> was relieving the
distressed and the down-trodden in the East, with no less
liberality than he had evinced a little while before in relieving
them in the North of Europe.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_698'>698</span>The time which works of good-samaritanism such as
these left unoccupied was given to a vast series—or rather
to a succession of series—of explorations which have had
already a noble result, and which will yield more and more
fruit for many a year to come. The scene of them embraced
Mexico, the United States, British America, Denmark, and
several Departments of Southern and Western France.
Their period reached from 1860—when he had just
entered the fiftieth year of his age—almost to the day of
his lamented and sudden death in the May of 1865. His
able and beloved friend and fellow-worker <span class='sc'>Lartet</span> was with
him in the Allier, when the fatal illness struck him, at the
age of fifty-four. It will be pardoned me, I trust, if in this
connection I quote, once again, those thoughtful words,
out of the private note-book of Lord <span class='sc'>Bacon</span>, which I applied
in a former chapter to another and more recent public
loss—‘Princes,&#160;... when men deserve crowns for their
performances, do not crown them below, where the deeds
are performed, but call them up. So doth <span class='sc'>God</span>, by death.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Character of the Christy Museum.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The little that need here be added as to the nature and
extent of Mr. <span class='sc'>Christy’s</span> gift to the Public, will be best
said in the words of the present able Curator of the Collection,
Mr. A. W. <span class='sc'>Franks</span>. But it should be first premised
that the posthumous gift was only the continuation
of a long series of gifts, which embraced the Museums, not
of England alone, but those of Northern and of Southern
Europe, and (as I think) some of those of America:—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Ancient Europe and part of North America.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Among the most important contents of the <span class='sc'>Christy</span>
Museum is a collection of stone implements from the Drift.
They are the most ancient remains of human industry
hitherto discovered; they include a remarkably fine series
from St. Acheul, near Amiens. Antiquities found in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_699'>699</span>Caves of Dordogne, were excavated by Mr. <span class='sc'>Christy</span> and M.
<span class='sc'>Lartet</span>, at the expense of the former. This collection is
very extensive, and includes a number of drawings on reindeer
bone and horn, probably some of the most ancient works
of art that have been preserved. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Franks’
<cite>Report on
Christy
Museum</cite>
(abridged).<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
It would have been still
more extensive, had it not been known that Mr. <span class='sc'>Christy</span>
intended to present the unique specimens to the French
Museum, an intention which the Trustees under his Will have
felt bound to fulfil. The Museum includes many ancient
stone implements found on the surface, in England and
Ireland, France, Belgium, and Denmark. The last of these
is a remarkable collection, and includes a good series from
the Danish Kitchenmiddens. A few specimens from Italy
are also to be found; a valuable collection from the caves at
Gibraltar; and specimens from the Swiss Lakes. For convenience,
a case of ancient stone implements from Asia has
been placed in this room, as well as the more modern
implements, dresses, and weapons of the Esquimaux of
America and Asia, and of the maritime tribes of the North-West
Coast of America. These furnish striking illustrations
of the remains found in the Caves of Dordogne, and prove
that, while the climate was similar to that of the northern
countries in question, the inhabitants of that part of France
must have resembled the Esquimaux in their habits and
implements.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Africa and Asia.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The African Collection is very extensive, and supplies a
lacuna in the collections of the British Museum, where
there are few objects from this continent. The same may
be said of the series from the Asiatic Islands. The collection
from Asia proper is not very numerous; the races
now occupying that continent being generally in a more
advanced state of civilization than that which especially
interested Mr. <span class='sc'>Christy</span>. Attention should, however, be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_700'>700</span>called to two valuable relics from China; an Imperial State
Seal carved in jade, and a set of tablets of the same material,
on which has been engraved a poem by the Emperor
<span class='sc'>Kien-Lung</span>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Melanesia and Polynesia.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The Polynesian Room contains a valuable collection of
weapons, ornaments, and dresses, both from the islands
inhabited by the black races of the Pacific, and from those
of Polynesia proper. Many of the specimens are of interest,
as belonging to a state of culture which has now
completely changed, and as illustrating manners and customs
that have disappeared before the commerce and the
teaching of Europeans.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Asia.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In the ‘Asian Room’ are placed the larger objects from
the Pacific, such as spears, clubs, and paddles. The collection
of spears is very large and interesting.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Australia and part of North America.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The Australian Collection is very complete, and it would
not be easy to replace it, inasmuch as the native races are
dwindling in most parts of that continent.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>North and South America.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The American department in chief includes antiquities
and recent implements and dresses from the North American
Indians; ancient Carib implements; and recent collections
from British Guiana, and other parts of South America.
The most valuable part of the contents of this room
is the collection of Mexican antiquities, which is not only
extensive, but includes some specimens of great rarity.
Among them should be especially mentioned the following:—An
axe of Avanturine jade, carved into the form of
a human figure; a remarkable knife of white chalcedony;
a sacrificial collar formed of a hard green stone; a squatting
figure, of good execution, sculptured out of a volcanic
rock; and three remarkable specimens coated with polished
stones. The latter consist of a wooden mask covered with
a mosaic of blue stones, presumed to be turquoises, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_701'>701</span>more probably a rare form of amazon-stone; a human skull
made into a mask, and coated with obsidian and the blue
stone mentioned above; and a knife with a blade of flint,
and with a wooden handle, sculptured to represent a
Mexican divinity, and encrusted with obsidian, coral,
malachite, and other precious materials. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Franks’
<cite>Report</cite>,
as above.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
There is also a
small but choice collection of Peruvian pottery.</p>

<p class='c011'>A catalogue of the collection was privately printed by
Mr. <span class='sc'>Christy</span> in 1862; but it embraces only a small part
of the present collection. A more extended catalogue is in
preparation.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is due to accuracy to add that the aspect of the rooms
devoted to the <span class='sc'>Christy</span> Museum in Victoria Street, and
the facilities of study which they afford, are utterly unsatisfactory
to real students. They are adapted only to holiday
sightseers, who look and go, and but to very small groups,
indeed, even of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every praise is due both to the Trustees and to their
officer, for having done their best, under strait and lamentable
limitations, the <em>removal</em> of which is the duty of Parliament
and of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, not that
of the Trustees. Under the Premiership of such an eminent
scholar and writer as Mr. <span class='sc'>Gladstone</span>, humbler students
of history and of literature would fain hope that a
long-standing reproach will speedily be removed; but his
ministerial surroundings are unfriendly to such anticipations.
After words which we have recently heard, <em>from
the Treasury Bench itself</em>, about Public Parks, there is only
scanty ground for hope that much improvement can, under
existing circumstances, be looked for in respect to Public
Museums.</p>

<p class='c011'>At all events, the condition, as to space, of the <span class='sc'>Christy</span>
Museum in Victoria Street, no less than the condition, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_702'>702</span>that respect, of portions of the general Museum of Antiquities
at Bloomsbury itself—and of nearly all our splendid
national collections in Natural History—gives tenfold importance
to that question of speedy enlargement or efficient
reconstruction which it will be my duty rather to state,
than to discuss, in the next chapter. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The state

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The archæological bequest of James Woodhouse, of Corfu.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Next in importance—but next at a long interval—to
the accessions which the Nation owes to the munificence of
Henry <span class='sc'>Christy</span>, comes the bequest of Mr. James <span class='sc'>Woodhouse</span>,
of Corfu, the circumstances attendant upon which
have much singularity.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is only of late years (speaking comparatively) that
British Consuls have become at all notable as collectors of
antiquities. But when once the new fashion was set, it
spread rapidly, and it may now be hoped that there will be
as little lack of continuance as of speed. In Chapter V, I
had to mention (though very inadequately to the worth of
their labours) several Consuls in the Levant, who have
eminently distinguished themselves in augmenting our
National Museum. But in this chapter the reader must be
introduced to a Consul who rather obstructed than promoted
a worthy public object.</p>

<p class='c011'>James <span class='sc'>Woodhouse</span> was a British subject engaged in
commerce, who had resided for many years at Corfu (where
for a time he had filled the office of Government Secretary),
and who consoled his self-imposed exile by collecting a
cabinet of coins, which eventually became one of great
value, and also an extensive museum of miscellaneous, but
chiefly of Greek, antiquities. Repeatedly, during his lifetime,
he announced his desire and purpose to perpetuate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_703'>703</span>his collection by giving it to the British Museum. When
his health failed, he began to superintend in person the
packing up of the most valuable portions of his museum;
but illness grew upon him, and he was forced to leave off
his preparations abruptly.</p>

<p class='c011'>A delicate circumstance connected with his family circle
seems to have combined with this regretted interruption,
by increasing illness, of his precautionary measures and
intentions (the secure fulfilling of which lay near his heart),
to make him uneasy and anxious.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The circumstances
of the
Woodhouse
bequest.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
He sent for a legal
friend, Dr. <span class='sc'>Zambelli</span>; told him of his plans, and also of
his fears that they might be—in the event of his sudden
death, and he felt that death was fast coming—obstructed.
<span class='sc'>Zambelli</span> told him that the person to whom his purpose
and wishes ought to be communicated, without delay, was
undoubtedly the British Consul-General, Mr. <span class='sc'>Saunders</span>.
In joint communication with both of them, a deed of gift
was prepared. ‘Having been engaged,’ said the donor,
‘in numismatic pursuits,&#160;... and being desirous that
the Collection of Coins <em>and other Antiquities</em> so formed by
me, should be dedicated to national purposes, I give,’ and
so on. No inventory, however, had been made when the
donor died, on the twenty-sixth of February, 1866. Before
<span class='sc'>Woodhouse’s</span> death, Mr. Consul-General <span class='sc'>Saunders</span> put a
guard round the house; and, immediately after the event,
sent away all the household, taking official possession of
the whole of the effects, in the manner usual in cases of
undoubted <em>intestacy</em>.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c013'><sup>[47]</sup></a> He then, according to his own statement,
set about ‘selecting such portions’ of Mr. <span class='sc'>Woodhouse’s</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_704'>704</span>property as ‘seemed’ (to him and to a clerical
friend of the collector) ‘<em>suitable</em> for the British Museum.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Most naturally, when the intelligence came to the Museum,
it was thought by the Trustees that Mr. <span class='sc'>Saunders</span> had both
very seriously exceeded, and very gravely fallen short of,
his obvious official duty. ‘Selection’ was felt to have been
superfluous in respect to any and every item, of every kind,
belonging to the donor’s museum. Just as plainly, the
instant forwarding of the whole, on the other hand, was a
peremptory obligation upon the British Consul.</p>

<p class='c011'>Eventually (and by the zealous exertions of Sir A.
<span class='sc'>Panizzi</span> and of Mr. Charles <span class='sc'>Newton</span>, respectively, on behalf
of the Trustees) conclusive evidence was placed before Lord
<span class='sc'>Stanley</span> (the now Earl of <span class='sc'>Derby</span>, and then, it will be
remembered, Foreign Secretary of State) that Mr. Consul-General
<span class='sc'>Saunders</span> had divided the Woodhouse antiquities
into <em>two</em> portions, and had then proceeded to allot the
smaller portion to the British Museum, and the larger to
the ‘heirs-at-law’ of the deceased. Nor is it yet quite
certain that such division was <em>all</em> the division that occurred.</p>

<p class='c011'>After long inquiries and much correspondence—as well
between the Foreign Office and the Queen’s Advocate, as
between the Trustees and their officers on the one hand, and
various persons at Corfu, including, of course, the Consul-General
himself, on the other—Lord <span class='sc'>Stanley</span> touched
the point of the affair with characteristic keenness when he
wrote, in his despatch to Mr. <span class='sc'>Saunders</span> of the seventh of
January, 1867: ‘Your neglect to <em>make an Inventory</em> of the
effects of the deceased has been the main cause of the doubts
which have been felt as to the propriety of your conduct in
this matter, and of the inquiry which has been the consequence
of those doubts.’</p>

<p class='c011'>But that neglect was then incurable. And, subsequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_705'>705</span>to the despatch thus worded, further inquiry has but made
the omission more regrettable. The making of the Inventory
had been pressed on Mr. <span class='sc'>Saunders’</span> attention at
the time of the Collector’s death.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Newton; in <cite>Returns to Parliament</cite>, of the year 1866.</div>

<p class='c011'>That part of the <span class='sc'>Woodhouse</span> Museum which came to
England in 1866 included a very interesting Collection of
Greek Coins, chiefly from Corcyra, Western Greece, and
the Greek islands; an extensive series of rings and other
personal ornaments; some ancient glass; a few medallions;
a few sculptures, in marble, of doubtful antiquity; and last,
but far indeed from being least acceptable, a most beautiful
head of Athené in cameo, cut on a sardonyx.

It was
thought by the antiquary <span class='sc'>Vischer</span>—who saw this fine
cameo about the year 1854—that it represents the head of
<span class='sc'>Phidias’</span> famous statue in gold and ivory, and therefore
had a common origin with the jasper intaglio so often praised
by archæologists who have seen the Imperial Cabinet at
Vienna.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Lord Napier of Magdala, and the additions to the Museum of the Antiquities and MSS. of Abyssinia, 1867–8.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Some of my readers will remember that although war,
and the calamities which commonly accompany it, have
often devastated museums and libraries, it has occasionally
enriched them. Sometimes by sheer plunder, as under
<span class='sc'>Catharine</span> of Russia and the marshals of her predatory
armies. Sometimes by acts of genuine beneficence and
public spirit, as in Ireland under <span class='sc'>Blount</span> (afterwards Earl
of Devonshire); and, again, under the great Protector. Lord
<span class='sc'>Napier</span> adds his honoured name to the small category of
the soldiers who have justifiably turned victorious arms to
the profit of learning, and the enrichment of honestly built-up
national collections. I cannot, however, but regard as
utterly unworthy of the British arms and name certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_706'>706</span>acquisitions which were incidental to that campaign. ‘Mr.
<span class='sc'>Holmes</span>, the officer attached to the Abyssinian Expedition
by the Trustees of the British Museum’—I quote exactly
and literally from the ‘<cite>Accounts and Estimates</cite>’ of last year
(1869)—‘collected&#160;... among other objects, a silver chalice
and a paten bearing Æthiopic inscriptions, showing them to
have been given to various churches by King <span class='sc'>Theodore</span>.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The collection of Sacramental Plate in Abyssinia.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>I am certain to be uncontradicted when I assert, that
neither the Trustees of the British Museum, nor Lord
<span class='sc'>Napier</span> of Magdala, instructed Mr. <span class='sc'>Holmes</span> to take from
Christian churches in Abyssinia their sacramental plate, or
their processional crosses.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is a far pleasanter task to praise the diligence with
which Mr. <span class='sc'>Holmes</span> executed the Commission really given
him by the Trustees. He collected many specimens of
Abyssinian art and industry which were fit contributions to
the National Museum.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The collection
of
Abyssinian
MSS.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
In like manner, Lord <span class='sc'>Napier</span>
authorised the collection, partly by officers under his command,
and partly by the researches of Mr. <span class='sc'>Holmes</span>, of a
series of Abyssinian Manuscripts, extending to three hundred
and thirty-nine volumes. These were given to the
Museum by the then Secretary of State for India.</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The Slade bequest.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>In the same year with the Abyssinian spoils, came a
noble addition to the Art Collections of the Museum by the
bequest of the late Felix <span class='sc'>Slade</span>, and a rich addition to the
Library, by the purchase of the Japanese books collected
by the late Dr. <span class='sc'>Von Siebold</span>, during the later of his two
visits to Japan, a country which he so largely contributed to
make well known to the rest of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>Felix <span class='sc'>Slade</span> was the younger son of Robert <span class='sc'>Slade</span>, in
his day a well-known Proctor in Doctors’ Commons. Mr.
William <span class='sc'>Slade</span>, elder brother of Felix, had inherited the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_707'>707</span>valuable estate of Halsteads in Lonsdale (Yorkshire), under
the will of the last male-heir of that family, and on his early
death he was succeeded by his brother, the benefactor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Truly a ‘benefactor.’ To purposes of public charity he
bequeathed not less than seven thousand pounds, and
bequeathed that sum with wise forethought, and with
Christian generality of view. He founded and munificently
endowed Professorships of Art at each of the ancient Universities,
and at University College in London. To the
British Museum he gave the splendid bequest about to be
described, which had been selected with exquisite taste,
knowledge and judgment, and which, under such rare conditions
of purchase, had cost him more than twenty-five
thousand pounds.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Slade
Museum of
Antiquities.
1869.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I describe it in the precise words—chiefly
from the pen of one of his Executors—which are used in
the Return to Parliament of 1869:—‘The collection of glass
and other antiquities bequeathed to the Nation by the late
Felix <span class='sc'>Slade</span>, Esq., <span class='fss'>F.S.A.</span>, includes about nine hundred and
fifty specimens of ancient glass, selected with care, so as to
represent most of the phases through which the art of glass-working
has passed. Collected in the first instance with a
view to artistic beauty alone, the series has been since gradually
enriched with historical specimens, as well as with
curiosities of manufacture, so as to illustrate the history of
glass in all its branches.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of early Egyptian glass there are not many examples in
the collection; one of some interest is a case for holding
the <em>stibium</em>, used by the Egyptian ladies for the eye, and
which is in the form of a papyrus sceptre. The later productions
of Egypt are represented by some very minute
specimens of mosaic glass, formed of slender filaments
of various colours fused together, and cut into transverse
sections.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_708'>708</span>‘To the Phœnicians have been attributed the making of
many little vases of peculiar form and ornamentation that
are met with, not unfrequently, in tombs on the shores of
the Mediterranean. They are of brilliant colours, with zigzag
decoration, and exhibit the same technical peculiarities,
so that they must have been derived from one centre of
fabrication. Of these vases there is a considerable series,
showing most of the varieties of form and colour that are
known.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The collection is especially rich in vessels moulded into
singular shapes, found principally in Syria and the neighbouring
islands, and which were probably produced in the
workshops of Sidon, but at a later time; possibly as late as
the Roman dominion. The Museum Collections were previously
very ill provided with such specimens. To the
same date must belong a vase handle, stamped with the
name of <span class='sc'>Artas</span> the Sidonian, in Greek and Latin characters.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of Roman glass there is a great variety, as might be
expected from the skill shown in glass-making during the
Imperial times of Rome.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>A. W. Franks,
<cite>Account of
Slade
Museum</cite>, in
the Parliamentary
Returns of
1869.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Large vases were not especially
sought after by Mr. <span class='sc'>Slade</span>, but two fine cinerary urns may
be noticed, remarkable not only for their form, but for the
beautiful iridescent colours with which time has clothed
them. There is also a very fine amber-coloured ewer, with
blue filaments round the neck, which was found in the
Greek Archipelago; an elegant jug or bottle with diagonal
flutings, found at Barnwell, near Cambridge, and a brown
bottle, splashed with opaque white, from Germany. Of
cut glass, an art which it was formerly denied that the
Romans possessed, there are good examples; such, for
instance, is a boat-shaped vase of deep emerald hue, and of
the same make apparently as the Sacro Catino of Genoa; a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_709'>709</span>bowl cut into facets, found near Merseburg, in Germany;
and a cup, similarly decorated, found near Cambridge.
The last two specimens are of a brilliant clear white, imitating
rock crystal, a variety of glass much esteemed by the
Romans. Several vessels found in Germany are remarkable
for having patterns in coloured glass, trailed as it were over
the surface. There are two very fine bowls of millefiori
glass, one of them with patches of gold, and very numerous
polished fragments illustrating the great variety and taste
shown by the ancients in such vessels. Two vases exhibit
designs in intaglio; one of them, a subject with figures; the
other, a bowl found near Merseburg, exhibits the story of
Diana and Actæon; the goddess is kneeling at a pool of
water in a grotto; Actæon is looking on, and a reflection of
his head with sprouting horns may be distinguished in the
water at the goddess’s feet; to prevent any mistake, the
names of the personages, in Greek, are added. This bowl
may be of a late date, probably early Byzantine. Of vases
decorated in cameo, fragments alone are to be found in the
collection; but as only four entire vases are known, this is
not surprising. One of the fragments seems to be part of
a large panel which has represented buildings, &amp;c., and has
on it remains of a Greek inscription. There are several
glass cameos and intaglios, the representatives of original
gems that have long since been lost; one of the cameos is a
head of <span class='sc'>Augustus</span>; another represents an Egyptian princess;
whilst among the intaglios are several of great
excellence; of these should particularly be noticed a blue
paste representing Achilles wounded in the heel, and crouching
down behind his rich shield, a gem worthy of the best
period of Greek art. One of the rarest specimens in the
collection is a circular medallion of glass, on which is
painted a gryphon; the colours appear to be burnt in, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_710'>710</span>it is therefore a genuine specimen of ancient painting
on glass, of which but three other instances are known.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In the fourth and fifth century it was the habit to ornament
the bottoms of bowls and cups with designs in gold,
either fixed to the surface or enclosed between two layers of
glass. These specimens have generally been found in the
Catacombs of Rome; but two or three have been found at
Cologne, one of which is in the collection. It is the remains
of a disc of considerable size, with a central design,
now destroyed; around are eight compartments, with subjects
from the Old and New Testaments: Moses striking
the Rock, the History of Jonah, Daniel in the Lions’ Den,
the Fiery Furnace, the Sacrifice of Isaac, the Nativity, and
the Paralytic Man; of these, the Nativity is a very rare
representation.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of glass of a Teutonic origin there is but one specimen in
the collection, a tumbler of peculiar form, from a cemetery
at Selzen, in Rhenish Hesse. Like other glasses of the time,
it is so made that it cannot be put down until it has
been emptied, and thus testifies to the convivial habits of
the Teutons.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of early Byzantine glass but little is known; the bowl
with Diana and Actæon, already noticed, is very probably of
that period; and a Byzantine cameo with the head of <span class='sc'>Christ</span>
should be mentioned.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of glass of the middle ages, from the West of Europe,
but little or nothing has been preserved save the exquisite
painted glass in cathedrals and churches. Of the Eastern
glass of the same period several specimens are in the collection.
Among these is a very beautiful bottle, probably
of the thirteenth century, decorated with a minute pattern
of birds; a lamp of large size, made in Syria to hang in a
mosque, bears the name of <span class='sc'>Sheikhoo</span>, a man of great wealth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_711'>711</span>and importance in Egypt and Syria, who died in 1356, after
building a mosque at Cairo.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘To a later period of the Eastern glass works may be
referred an ewer of a sapphire blue, resplendent with gold
arabesques, and several other richly decorated pieces, all
made in Persia.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Venice for many centuries held the foremost place among
the makers of glass. Enriched, to begin with, by her very
extensive trade in beads, she received gladly the Byzantine
workers in glass, who had been driven out of Constantinople
by the Turks. Henceforward the variety of her glass wares
increased, and must have brought much profit. The earliest
glass vases which can with certainty be referred to Venice
are of the fifteenth century; of these, a large covered cup
with gilt ribs is remarkable for its early date and size. The
two finest specimens are, however, two goblets richly enameled;
one of them is blue, with a triumph of Venus; the
other green, with two portraits. These were the choicest
specimens in the <span class='sc'>Debruge</span> and <span class='sc'>Soltykoff</span> Collections successively,
and were obtained by Mr. <span class='sc'>Slade</span>, for upwards of
four hundred pounds, at the sale of the latter collection.
Among other enameled specimens may be noticed three
shallow bowls, or dishes, with heraldic devices: one has the
arms of Pope <span class='sc'>Leo X</span>, 1513–1521; another those of <span class='sc'>Leonardo
Loredano</span>, Doge of Venice, 1501–1521; and the
third the arms of <span class='sc'>Fabrizio Caretto</span>, Grand Master of the
Order of St. John of Jerusalem, 1513–1521.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The blown glasses of Venice are numerous and well
selected, exhibiting great beauty of outline and variety of
design. Among them should be especially remarked, a very
tall covered cup, surmounted with a winged serpent, from
the <span class='sc'>Bernal</span> Collection; and two drinking glasses, with enameled
flowers forming the stems.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_712'>712</span>‘The coloured vases display most of the hues made at
Venice; ruby, purple, green, and blue, as well as an opalescent
white and an opaque white, the latter often diversified
with splashes of other colours. To these may be added
various imitations of agate, avanturine, &amp;c.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Franks, as
above.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Another peculiar
fabric of Venice is well illustrated, the frosted glass
belonging generally to an early period.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In the production of millefiori glass the Venetians did not
equal the ancients, either in harmony of colour or variety of
design. The rosettes were formed of sections of canes, such
as were employed in making beads. The specimens of
this glass are rare, but there are not less than seven pieces
so ornamented in the collection.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of lace glass, one of the most remarkable productions of
Venice, and which nowhere has been carried to such perfection,
there are many fine specimens, both in form and
delicacy of pattern, as there are likewise of the variety called
reticelle. Among the latter is a tall covered cup with
snakes on the cover and in the stem; there should also be
noticed a drinking glass, in the stem of which is enclosed a
half sequin of the Doge <span class='sc'>Francesco Molino</span>, 1647.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Of unquestionably ancient French glass but few specimens
are known. This adds much to the value of a goblet
in the collection, with enameled portrait of Jehan <span class='sc'>Boucau</span>
and his wife Antoinette, made about 1530.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘German glass is fully represented: the earlier specimens
are richly decorated with enamel, chiefly heraldic devices;
they are dated 1571, 1572, &amp;c. A few are painted like
window glass, and among them is a cylindrical cup, dated
1662, on which is depicted the procession at the christening
of <span class='sc'>Maximilian Emmanuel</span>, afterwards Elector of Bavaria.
The later German specimens are engraved, and some of
them by artists of note. Of ruby glass, another production
<span class='pageno' id='Page_713'>713</span>for which Germany was famed, there are good specimens;
one bears the cypher of <span class='sc'>John George IV</span>, Elector of
Saxony, another that of <span class='sc'>Frederick the First</span>. <span class='sc'>Kunckel</span>,
to whom these glasses are attributed, was successively in
the service of both princes.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Though glass was early made in Flanders, the most
ancient specimens in the collection under this head have
been regarded as Venetian glasses decorated in the Low
Countries. If made at Venice, they must, from certain
peculiarities of form, have been designed for the Flemish
and Dutch markets. The ornaments are etched, and contain
allusions to the political events of the country: for
instance, the arms of the seventeen provinces chained to
those of Spain, and dated 1655; a portrait of <span class='sc'>Philip IV</span>;
<span class='sc'>William II</span> of Orange; his wife, <span class='sc'>Mary of England</span>;
<span class='sc'>Olden Barneveldt</span>, &amp;c. Some of the later specimens are
engraved on the lathe in a very ornamental manner, and
others delicately stippled. One of the latter bears the
name of F. <span class='sc'>Greenwood</span>, and others are attributed to
<span class='sc'>Wolf</span>.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In English glass the collection is not rich, the difficulty
of identifying such specimens being very great; some of
them are referred to the works at Bristol, which produced
ornamental glass about a century ago.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Some valuable additions to the collection of glass have
been received from the Executors of Mr. <span class='sc'>Slade</span>, purchased
by them out of funds set aside for the purpose. They are
nineteen in number, and among them may be especially
noticed a very fine Oriental bottle with elaborate patterns
in gold and enamel, together with figures of huntsmen, &amp;c.
It may be referred to the fourteenth century, and was formerly
in the possession of a noble family at Wurzburg. Two
specimens of Chinese glass, dated in the reign of the Emperor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_714'>714</span><span class='sc'>Kien-Lung</span>, 1736–1796; and several ancient Flemish
and Dutch glasses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Franks, as above.</div>

<p class='c011'>‘By the acquisition of the <span class='sc'>Slade</span> Collection the series of
ancient and more recent glass in the British Museum has
probably become more extensive, as well as more instructive,
than any other public collection of the kind, and it
will afford ample materials for study both to the artist and
the antiquary.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘In addition to his collection of glass, Mr. <span class='sc'>Slade</span> has
bequeathed to the Museum a small series of carvings in
ivory and metal work, from Japan, which are full of the
humour and quaintness which characterise the art of that
country.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘He has likewise bequeathed to the Museum such of the
miscellaneous works of art in his possession as should be
selected by one of his Executors, Mr. <span class='sc'>Franks</span>. The objects
so selected are not numerous, but include some valuable
additions to the National Collection.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Among them may be noticed the following:—Two very
beautiful Greek painted vases, œnochoæ with red figures of
a fine style; these were two of the gems of the <span class='sc'>Durand</span> and
<span class='sc'>Hope</span> Collections successively; also a fine tazza, with red
figures very well drawn, formerly in the <span class='sc'>Rogers</span> Collection.
Two red bowls of the so-called Samian ware, with ornaments
in relief; one of them was discovered near Capua,
the other is believed to have been found in Germany; an
antique hand, in rock crystal, of which a drawing by Santo
<span class='sc'>Bartoli</span> is preserved in the Royal Library at Windsor, and
a small Roman vase of onyx; a panel, probably from a
book cover, a fine example of German enamel of the twelfth
century, from the <span class='sc'>Preaux</span> Collection; a very fine flask-shaped
vase of Italian majolica, probably of Urbino ware,
and representing battle scenes; three elegant ewers, one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_715'>715</span>them made at Nevers, another of Avignon ware, and the
third probably Venetian—all three are rare specimens; an
oval plate of niello work on silver, and a silver plate engraved
in the style of <span class='sc'>Crispin de Passe</span>; three early specimens
of stamped leather work, commonly termed cuirbouilli;
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Franks, as
above.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
a tile from the Alhambra, but probably belonging
to the restorations made to that building in the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The value of Mr. <span class='sc'>Slade’s</span> bequest is considerably
increased by a very detailed and profusely illustrated
catalogue of the Collection which, having been prepared
during his lifetime, will be completed and distributed,
according to his directions.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘Since the <span class='sc'>Cracherode</span> bequest, which formed the
nucleus of the British Museum Print Collections, no
acquisition of the kind approaches the bequest of Mr.
<span class='sc'>Slade</span> in rare and choice specimens of etchings and
engravings, wherein nearly every artist of distinction is
represented. The collection comprises rare specimens of
impressions from Nielli and prints of the School of Baldini;
fine examples of some of the best productions of Andrea

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>The specimens of printing and binding in the Slade Collection.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>‘The specimens of binding from the <span class='sc'>Slade</span> Collection
(now placed in the Printed Book Department), continues
the Report of 1869, are twenty-three in number, chiefly of
foreign execution, and afford examples of the style of
<span class='sc'>Padeloup</span>, <span class='sc'>Dusseuil</span>, <span class='sc'>Derome</span>, and other eminent binders.
One of the volumes, an edition of <span class='sc'>Paulus Æmylius</span>, <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
gestis Francorum</span></cite> (Paris, 1555, 8vo), is a beautiful specimen
of the French style of the period, with the sides and
back richly ornamented in the Grolier manner. An Italian
translation of the works of Horace (Venice, 1581, 4to),
is of French execution, richly tooled, and bears the arms of
<span class='sc'>Henry III</span> of France. A folio volume of the <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reformation
der Stadt Nürnberg</span></cite> (Frankfort, 1566), which is a magnificent
specimen of contemporary German binding, formerly
belonged to the Emperor <span class='sc'>Maximilian the Second</span>, whose
arms are painted on the elegantly goffered gilt edges. An
edition of <span class='sc'>Ptolemy’s</span> <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Geographicæ Narrationis libri octo</span></cite>
(Lyons, 1541, fol.) affords a fine illustration of the Italian
style of about that date. The copy of a French translation
of <span class='sc'>Xenophon’s</span> <cite>Cyropædia</cite>, by Jacques de <span class='sc'>Vintemille</span>
(Paris, 1547, 4to), appears to have been bound for King
<span class='sc'>Edward VI</span>, of England, whose arms and cypher are on
the sides, while the rose is five times worked in gold on
the back.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>T. Watts,

A volume of Bishop <span class='sc'>Hall’s</span> <cite>Contemplations on

contemporary English binding, has the Royal arms in the
centre of the sides, and appears to have been the dedication

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Von Siebold and his Japanese Collections of 1823–8.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Philip <span class='sc'>Von Siebold</span> was born at Wurtzburg, in February,
1796, and in the university of that town he received his
education. He adopted the profession of medicine, but
devoted himself largely to the study of natural history. In
the joint capacity of physician and naturalist, he accompanied
the Dutch Embassy to Japan in the year 1823. He
was a true lover of humanity, as well as a lover of science.
Many Japanese students were taught by him both the
curative arts, and the passion for doing good to their fellow-men,
which ought to be the condition of their exercise
and practice. He won the respect of the Japanese, but
his ardent pursuit of knowledge brought him into great
peril.</p>

<p class='c011'>In 1828 he was about to return to Europe, laden with
scientific treasures, when he was suddenly seized and imprisoned
for having procured access to an official map of
the Empire, in order to improve his knowledge of its topography.
His imprisonment lasted thirteen months. At
last he was liberated, and ordered to do what he was just
about to do when arrested. (<span class='sc'>Siebold</span>, says his biographer,
<em>kam mit der Verbannung davon</em>.) But his banishment was
not perpetual. In 1859, he returned. He won favour
and employment from the then Tycoon. He returned
to his birthplace in 1862, and died there in October,
1866.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of his second library, Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span> wrote thus:—‘The
collection of Japanese books was one of two formed by Dr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_718'>718</span><span class='sc'>Von Siebold</span> during his residence in, and visits to, Japan.
The first of these collections, which is now at Leyden, and
of which a catalogue was published in 1845, was long
considered as beyond comparison the finest of its kind out
of Japan and China; but the second, now in the Museum,
is much superior. That at Leyden comprises five hundred
and twenty-five works, that in London one thousand and
eighty-eight works, in three thousand four hundred and
forty-one volumes. It contains specimens of every class of
literature: cyclopædias, histories, law-books, political pamphlets,
novels, plays, poetry, works on science, on antiquities,
on female costume, on cookery, on carpentry, and on
dancing. It abounds in works illustrative of the topography
of Japan, as, for instance, one, in twenty volumes,
on the secular capital Yeddo, and two, in eleven volumes,
on the religious capital Miaco; collections of views of
Yeddo and of the volcano Fusiyama, &amp;c. &amp;c. There are
also several dictionaries of European languages, testifying
to the eagerness with which the Japanese now pursue that
study. The Museum was already in possession of a second
edition of an English dictionary published at Yeddo in
1866, in which the lexicographer, <span class='sc'>Hori Tatsnoskay</span>, observes
in the preface, “As the study of the English language
is now becoming general in our country, we have
had for some time the desire to publish a pocket dictionary
of the English and Japanese languages, as an assistance to
our scholars,” and adds that the first edition is “entirely
sold out.” These dictionaries may now assist Europeans
to study the language of Japan, and it is believed that the
Japanese Library now in the Museum will afford unequalled
opportunities for the study of its literature.’</p>

<p class='c011'>This was the last sentence in the last official report
which Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span> lived to write, for the purpose of being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_719'>719</span>laid before Parliament. He died on the ninth of September,
1869, at the age of fifty-nine. His post was not
filled up until the end of December, when he was succeeded
by Mr. William Brenchley <span class='sc'>Rye</span>, who was then Senior
Assistant-Keeper in the Department of Printed Books.
Mr. <span class='sc'>Rye</span> is well known in literature. He has edited,
with great ability, several works of early travel for the useful
‘Hakluyt Society,’—an employment which he has often
shared with his friends and Museum colleagues Messrs.
Winter <span class='sc'>Jones</span> and Richard Henry <span class='sc'>Major</span>, and with like
honourable distinction in its performance. More recently,
he has increased his reputation by a book which has
been largely read, and which well deserves its popularity—<cite>England
as seen by Foreigners</cite>. This work was published
in 1865.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>The various Projects and Plans proposed, at different times,
for the Severance, the Partial Dispersion, and the Rearrangement,
of the several integral Collections which
at present form</em> ‘The British Museum.’</p>

<div  class='c002'></div>
<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Grosley’s idea of severing the Museum Collections, 1765.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The first reconstructor, in imagination, of the British
Museum on the plan of severing the literature from the
scientific collections, was a speculative and clever Frenchman,
Peter John <span class='sc'>Grosley</span>, who visited it within less
than six years of its being first opened to public inspection.
<span class='sc'>Grosley</span> expressed great admiration for much that he saw,
and he also criticised some of the arrangements that seemed
to him defective, with freedom but with courtesy. Some of
my readers will probably think that he hit a real blot, at
that time, when he said: ‘The Printed Books are the
weakest part of this immense collection. The building
cannot contain such a Library as England can form and
ought to form for the ornament of its capital. It has a
building quite ready in the “Banquetting-House” [at
Whitehall], and that building could be enlarged from time
to time as occasion might require.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_721'>721</span>Other writers, at various periods, have advocated
the severance of collections which seemed to them
too multifarious to admit of full, natural, and equable
development, in common. There is perhaps no apparent
reason, on the surface, why a great Nation should not be
able to enlarge the most varied public collections as effectively,
and as impartially, within one building, as within half
a dozen buildings. Nor does there seem to be any necessary
connection between the wise and liberal government of
public collections, and their severance or division into many
buildings, rather than their combination within a single
structure. Nevertheless it is certain that many thinkers
have, by some process or other, reached the conclusion that
severance would favour improvement.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Mr. Watts’ proposition for the severance of the Museum Collections, 1837.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Seventy years after <span class='sc'>Grosley</span> wrote, Thomas <span class='sc'>Watts</span> revived
the proposition of dividing the contents of the British
Museum, but he revived it in a new form. His idea was to
remove the Antiquities and to retain at Montagu House
both the Libraries and the Natural History Collections.
‘The pictures have been removed,’ wrote Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span> in
1837, ‘why should not the statues follow? The collections
at the Museum would then remain of an entirely homogeneous
character. It would be exclusively devoted to conveying
literary information; while the collection at the
National Gallery would have for its object to refine and
cultivate the taste.’</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not by any oversight that Mr. <span class='sc'>Watts</span> spoke of
the ‘homogeneity’ of Manuscripts, Printed Books, and
Natural-History Collections. He (at the time) meant
what he said.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Watts, in
<cite>Mechanics’
Magazine</cite>,
vol. xxvi,
pp. 295, seqq.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But I doubt if the naturalists would feel
flattered by the reason which he gives in illustration of his
opinion. ‘The various curiosities accumulated at the
Museum might be considered,’ he continues, ‘as a vast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_722'>722</span>assemblage of <em>book-plates</em>, serving to illustrate and elucidate
the literature of the Library.’</p>

<p class='c011'>Be that as it may, the idea of removing either the
Antiquities or the Printed Books has long ceased to be
mooted. All who now advocate severance advise, I think,
that the Natural History Collections should be removed,
and none other than those. But hitherto the idea of severance,
in any shape, has been uniformly repudiated both
by Royal Commissions of Inquiry, and by Parliamentary
Committees. The question, however, is sure to be revived,
and that speedily. Ere long it must needs receive a final
parliamentary solution—aye or no.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this chapter I shall endeavour to state,—and as I hope
with impartiality,—the main reasons which have been severally
adduced, both by those who advocate a severance, and
by those who recommend the continuance of the existing
union of all the varied and vast Collections now at Bloomsbury.
There can be no better introduction of the subject than
that which will be afforded by putting before the reader, on
the one hand, a detailed and well-considered plan which contemplated
the maintenance of the Museum as it is; and, on
the other, the elaborate report in favour of transferring the
scientific collections to a new site,—in order to gain ample
space at Bloomsbury for a great Museum of Literature and
Archæology, such as should be in every point of view worthy
of the British Empire,—which was approved of by a
Treasury Minute more than eight years ago.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of the several schemes and projects of extension which
rest on the twofold basis of (1) the retention at Bloomsbury
of nearly all the existing collections, with ample space for
their prospective increase, and (2) such an effective internal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_723'>723</span>re-arrangement of the collections themselves as would greatly
increase the public facilities of access and study, none
better deserves the attention of the reader than that which
was submitted in the first instance to the Trustees of the
British Museum, and subsequently to Parliament (in 1860)
by Mr. Edmund <span class='sc'>Oldfield</span>, then a Senior Assistant in the
Department of Antiquities, entrusted (in succession to Mr.
C. T. <span class='sc'>Newton</span>, on his proceeding to Greece) with the charge
of the Greek and Roman Galleries. By this plan it is proposed
to erect on the west side of the Museum a new range
of Galleries for Greek and Roman Antiquities. The façade
in Charlotte Street—prolonged to the house No. 4 in
Bedford Square—would extend to about 440 feet in length,
with an usual depth of 140, increased at the southern extremity
to 190 feet. This new range would provide for
the whole of the present Greek, Roman, Phœnician, and
Etruscan Antiquities, and for considerable augmentations.
To Assyrian Antiquities would be assigned the present
Elgin Gallery, the ‘Mausoleum Room,’ and the ‘Hellenic
Room,’ together with two other rooms—gained in part by
new adaptations of space comprised within the existing
buildings. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Mr.
Oldfield’s
Project of
Reconstruction
of the
Galleries
of Antiquities
(1858–1860).</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The rooms now devoted to the Antiquities of
Kouyunjik and Nimroud would then be applied to the
reception of Egyptian Antiquities, together with a room to
be constructed on the site of the present principal staircase.
The Lycian Gallery would retain its site, with an enlargement
westward. I quote Mr. <span class='sc'>Oldfield’s</span> own descriptive
account of his project, in full, from the Appendix to the
<cite>Minutes of Evidence</cite> of 1860.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Entrance Hall.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>I. <em>Entrance Hall.</em>—On the north side is a staircase, such as suggested
by Mr. <span class='sc'>Panizzi</span>, forming the access to the galleries of Natural History.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Private Room for Sculptures.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>II. Room for the first reception, unpacking, and examination of sculptures,
the consideration of such as are offered for purchase, the cleaning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_724'>724</span>and repairing of marbles and mosaics, and storing of pedestals, mason’s
apparatus, and machinery, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>First Egyptian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>III. <em>First Egyptian Room.</em>—The present two staircases, and the wall
at the east end of the Assyrian Transept being removed, a handsome
entrance would be obtained to the galleries of Antiquities. The room
would be about seventy-six feet by thirty-five, and though not very well
lighted, might suffice for the monuments of the first twelve dynasties of
Egypt, at present in the northern vestibule and lobby, which have no
very artistic character.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Second Egyptian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>IV. <em>Second Egyptian Room.</em>—The monuments of the Eighteenth
Dynasty would here commence. Terminating the vista from the north
would be the head of Thothmes III, more advantageously seen than in its
present position, where it stands in front of a doorway, and exposed to
a cross light.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Third Egyptian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>V. <em>Third Egyptian Room.</em>—For smaller remains of the same period.
The alcoves should be removed, and a door opened on the north side.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Fourth Egyptian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>VI. <em>Fourth Egyptian Room.</em>—To remedy the darkness of this room,
an opening should be made in the ceiling, inclosed by a balustrade in
the room above (<em>v.</em> Plan of Upper Floor), and covered with glass;
whilst the roof of this upper room should be lightened, at least in the
central compartment, by substituting glass for its present heavy ceiling.
The small space thus sacrificed in the floor of the upper room would be
a less serious loss than the virtual uselessness of so large an apartment
below. With the proposed improvement in the lighting, the Fourth
Egyptian Room would be well adapted for the colossal monuments of
Amenophis III; without it, the room could hardly serve for any purpose
but a passage.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Fifth Egyptian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>VII. <em>Fifth Egyptian Room.</em>—In the middle would be arranged, in two
rows, the remaining sculptures of the Eighteenth and part of those of
the Nineteenth Dynasty. In the recesses between the pilasters might
be fixed wall-cases, which would rather improve than impair the architectural
effect of the room, and for which the light is well adapted, the
rays from the opposite windows striking sufficiently low to obviate the
shadow occasioned by shelves in rooms lighted from above. Such cases
would contain small objects from the Egyptian collection now on the
Upper Floor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Sixth Egyptian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>VIII. <em>Sixth Egyptian Room.</em>—This room, originally ill lighted, has
been further darkened by the new Reading-Room, erected within a few
yards of its windows. If, however, an opening were made in the
ceiling (as proposed for Room VI), and if the roof of the room above
were somewhat modified, light might be thrown both on the magnificent
bust of Rameses II and on the east wall of the room. The middle
window in that wall, which furnishes no available light, might then be
blocked up; and before it might stand the cast from the head of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_725'>725</span>colossus at Abousimbul, now placed over a door in the northern vestibule,
but which ought, in any re-arrangement, to be united with the
other monuments of Rameses II, and which would finely terminate the
vista, looking from the west.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Seventh Egyptian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>IX. <em>Seventh Egyptian Room.</em>—Here would be the sculptures, both of
the native dynasties posterior to the Nineteenth, and of the Ptolemaic
and Roman periods, which at present occupy the southern Egyptian
Gallery. In the recesses between the pilasters might be wall-cases.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Eighth Egyptian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>X. <em>Eighth Egyptian Room.</em>—This, and the two succeeding rooms,
would be appropriated to smaller Egyptian remains. The light on the
western side of these rooms falls so nearly vertically, from the overshadowing
mass of building adjoining, that wall-cases would have their
contents completely thrown into shade by the shelves, or by the tops of
the cases. Objects in the middle of the room, on the other hand, would
be in uninterrupted light. It is, therefore, proposed to place against
the walls inscribed tablets, which are best seen under an acutely striking
light; painted plaster friezes, which, from their strong colours and
coarse execution, do not require much light; and framed papyri, which
are liable to injury from exposure to powerful light. Along the centre
of the room would be arranged mummies, and mummy cases, in glass
frames, with table-cases for scarabæi, and other small objects, which are
most conveniently exhibited on flat or sloping surfaces.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Ninth Egyptian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XI. <em>Ninth Egyptian Room.</em>—The thoroughfare is here too great for
objects to be conveniently arranged in the centre; but the walls might
be occupied as in the preceding room.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Tenth Egyptian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XII. <em>Tenth Egyptian Room.</em>—To be arranged similarly to the
Eighth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Summary of accommodation for Egyptian Antiquities.</span></div>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Summary</span> of the Accommodation provided in the plan for <span class='sc'>Egyptian
Antiquities</span>:—</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The large sculptures would gain Rooms III, IV, and VI, in lieu
of the northern vestibule.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The inscribed tablets, which at present occupy the recesses of
Rooms VII, VIII, IX, containing four hundred and twenty-two linear
feet of wall-space, and the walls of the northern vestibule, containing
about eighty feet, or altogether about five hundred and two feet, would
share with the framed papyri and painted plaster friezes the walls of
Rooms III, IV, V, VI, VIII, X, XI, XII, containing altogether
about nine hundred and sixty feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The mummies, overcrowded in a room containing two thousand and
fourteen square feet of available open space, and the coffins in the
present ‘Egyptian Ante-room,’ would be arranged, with several table
cases, in Rooms X and XII, containing altogether about four thousand
and eighty square feet.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The small objects, now in wall-cases extending to two hundred and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_726'>726</span>thirty-seven feet of linear measurement, and in three table-cases, would
be arranged in wall-cases, extending to three hundred and eighty-three
feet, and in several table-cases, of which the exact extent cannot be
fixed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The additional space here provided for large Egyptian sculptures is
not so much needed for the present as is the case in some other series;
but the greater comparative difficulty of moving objects so bulky makes
it advisable to secure, as far as possible, the permanence of any re-arrangement,
by leaving room for the probable incorporations of future
years. The accommodation provided for smaller objects is little more
than they already require for advantageous display.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>First Assyrian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XIII. <em>First Assyrian or Nimroud Room.</em>—This room, on the site of
the basement room, would be formed by demolishing the small room,
with the adjoining students’ room and staircase; by extending over
their site the glass roof of room; by throwing a floor, on a continuous
level with those of the adjoining galleries, and supported upon iron
pillars, over so much of room as is coloured brown in the plan; and by
carrying up thin partitions from this floor to the glass roof, so as to
inclose a new apartment. This apartment would, at the south end,
extend across the whole breadth of room, but elsewhere it would be
limited to a central space, nineteen feet wide, corresponding to the
present central compartment of room, so as to leave open an area of ten
feet wide on each side. The open areas would serve to light both the
whole room below, of which the central portion would be partially
obscured by the new structure, and also the rooms in the adjoining basements,
which, though no longer used for exhibition, might be serviceable
for other subordinate purposes. In one of the open areas might be a
private staircase to the basement. Room XIII would be considerably
loftier than the present ‘Nimroud Side Gallery,’ and it would contain
two thousand nine hundred and seventy superficial feet, and three hundred
and fourteen linear feet of wall-space, instead of two thousand one
hundred and seventy-six superficial feet, and two hundred and seventy-eight
feet of wall-space. In this new room would be placed the earliest
of the Assyrian monuments, those of Sardanapalus I; at the south
end those found in the two small temples at Nimroud, including the
colossal lion, the arched monolith and altar, and the mythological
figures from a doorway; in the northern portion, the sculptures from
the North-west Palace at Nimroud, including the small winged lion and
bull, now in room.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Second Assyrian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XIV. <em>Second Assyrian Room.</em>—This would contain a continuation of
the series from Nimroud. On the west side the colossal winged lions
now in the western compartment of the Assyrian Transept, which would
complete the monuments of Sardanapalus I; in other parts of the
room, the few but important sculptures of Divanubara, Shammaz-Phal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_727'>727</span>and Pul, now somewhat scattered for want of the requisite accommodation
in room, but for which there would here be ample space, and an
advantageous light.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Third Assyrian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XV. A proposed new room, to be entitled the <em>Third Assyrian or
Khorsabad Room</em>, the Assistant-Keeper’s study being removed, and
accommodation being provided for him elsewhere. The room might be
forty-seven feet by forty, about the same height as XIV, and similarly
lighted by a central skylight; beneath it would be a basement
room for the uses of the establishment. Room XV would contain, first,
the bas-reliefs of Tiglathpileser II from the South-west edifice of Nimroud;
and secondly, the Khorsabad collection, or monuments of Sargina,
which is next in chronological order to the Nimroud collection. The
two colossal bulls of Sargina are marked in the plan as facing each
other, an arrangement common at Khorsabad. Deducting space for
the bulls, upwards of eighty linear feet of wall-surface would remain in
the room, which is considerably more than the bas-reliefs of Tiglathpileser
and Sargina require. The new building would necessarily
obscure some of the windows of the adjoining basement, but this is of
minor importance; and the evil might be diminished on the western
and southern side, by leaving open spaces in the floor behind each of
the colossal bulls. Between the bulls would be a passage to</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Fourth Assyrian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XVI. <em>Fourth Assyrian or Sennacherib Room.</em>—Here would be the
first part of the collection discovered at Koyunjik, the monuments of
Sennacherib, now inconveniently divided, and arranged partly in the
‘Koyunjik Gallery,’ and partly in the ‘Assyrian Basement Room.’
These monuments consist, almost entirely, of bas-reliefs, extending
as at present arranged, to about three hundred and fifty-one feet
(two hundred and eight on the ground floor, and one hundred and
forty-three in the basement). In a lofty and wide room, however, such
as XVI, an upper row of bas-reliefs might be introduced over many of
the smaller slabs, now arranged in a single row only; by this means
the sculptures of Sennacherib might all be included on the east, west,
and north sides of the room, containing three hundred and seventeen
linear feet of wall-space, leaving the south side, or twenty-seven feet,
for sculptures of Sardanapalus III, the last monarch of the Assyrian
series. In the centre of the room would be glass cases for the numerous
tablets, cylinders, and other small objects of this collection, which
it is most instructive to exhibit in connection with the sculptures. The
only architectural alteration desirable in the room would be to open
skylights in the lateral portion of the roof, and to close those in the
central, in order to obtain a sharper light, upon the principle so successfully
adopted in the present ‘Nimroud Side Gallery.’</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Fifth Assyrian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XVII. <em>Fifth Assyrian Room.</em>—Here would be the continuation
of the monuments of Sardanapalus III, which conclude the Assyrian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_728'>728</span>department; they are at present divided like those of Sennacherib, and
part exhibited in the ‘Koyunjik Gallery,’ part in the basement room;
altogether they now extend to three hundred and seventy-three feet;
but as the greater part might, in Room XVII, be very well arranged in
double rows, and some of those in single rows might, without injury, be
less widely spread, two hundred and twenty-five feet would suffice for
their exhibition; of this space twenty-seven feet would be supplied by
Room XVI, and the remainder by XVII. The centre of the room
should be appropriated as the preceding, and the lighting similarly
modified.</p>

<p class='c007'>It thus appears that the wall-space provided in the plan, though one
hundred and twenty-seven feet more than the wall-space in the existing
rooms, falls short by one hundred and twenty-seven feet of the total
linear extent of the bas-reliefs, as now arranged. In lieu, however, of
placing slabs in the middle of a gallery, as is done in the basement
room, and as it would likewise be possible to do in XVI or XVII, it is
thought better, in these last rooms, to provide the additional space by
simply carrying up the slabs to a greater height.</p>

<p class='c007'>The space for central cases for small objects, which is at present four
thousand and eighty square feet in rooms would be eight thousand one
hundred and seventy square feet in Rooms XVI and XVII, an amount
so abundant as to supersede the necessity for any wall-cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The accommodation here provided for Assyrian antiquities is little
more in quantity, though much better in quality, than the present.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_729'>729</span>But this is nearly the only branch of the archæological collections to
which there seems little probability of future additions. If, contrary to
expectation, any such should be made, a supplemental room might be
built on the vacant space to the north of the Assyrian galleries.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Persian Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XVIII. <em>Persian Room.</em>—The sculptures to be here exhibited, which
are all bas-reliefs, would probably not occupy more than half the wall-space,
which is forty-seven linear feet. They belong chiefly to the sixth
century, <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and properly therefore succeed the Assyrian, which range
from the tenth to the seventh century, <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Lycian Gallery.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XIX. <em>Lycian Gallery.</em>—It is intended to reserve this room for the
monuments peculiarly characteristic of Lycia, and to transfer to the
Greek galleries those in which the Greek element is predominant; such
as, particularly, the sculptures of the Ionic trophy monument or <em>heroum</em>
from Xanthus, now scattered over the room, and, if necessary, the casts
from the rock tomb at Myra. This would leave abundant space for the
purely Lycian remains. The harpy tomb, of which the bas-reliefs furnish
a very important illustration of archaic Greek art, might best be
placed in an isolated position near the entrance to the Greek galleries,
where it would be favourably lighted and conspicuously seen. Its present
place might be filled by the rude sarcophagus with sculptures of
lions. The lighting of the Lycian room, which is very defective, should
be improved by an alteration in the roof; but it is thought better not
to enter into the details of such alteration in the present paper.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>First Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XX. <em>First Greek or Inscription Room.</em>—The room beneath this being
supposed to be withdrawn from exhibition, the staircase at the west end
should be separated by a partition, and entered through a private door.
All Greek inscriptions, except the sepulchral, and such as are engraved
on architectural or sculptural monuments, would be here collected.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point the new buildings commence with—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Second Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXI. <em>Second Greek or Branchidæ Room</em>, thirty feet by twenty-four.—The
height both of this and the four succeeding rooms should be about
twenty feet. This would contain the earliest Greek sculptures, of which
the principal are those procured by Mr. <span class='sc'>Newton</span> from Branchidæ. The
ten seated statues would be arranged on each side, as in the ‘Sacred
Way’ at that place, and the recumbent inscribed lion and the sphinx
placed at the end of the room.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Third Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXII. <em>Third Greek Room</em>, twenty-four feet by seventeen.—This would
contain other archaic works, including the casts from Selinus.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Fourth Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXIII. <em>Fourth Greek or Æginetan Room</em>, thirty-eight feet by twenty-four.—Here
would be fixed, in two recesses, the restorations of the two
pedimental groups from Ægina, which are exactly of the length of this
room, and which might be placed at a more convenient level for examination
than their present elevated position in room.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Fifth Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXIV. <em>Fifth Greek Room</em>, seventeen feet by twenty-four.—On a pedestal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_730'>730</span>facing the great Greek gallery, might stand the semi-archaic Apollo,
from Byzantium.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Sixth Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXV. <em>Sixth Greek or Phigaleian Room</em>, thirty-eight feet by twenty-four.—Here
would be the casts from the Temple of Theseus, and the
sculptures and casts from the Temple of Wingless Victory, both of the
middle of the fifth century, <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>; also the Phigaleian collection, which
is a somewhat later production of the same school. The friezes, arranged
in two rows, would just fill the room.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Seventh Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXVI. <em>Seventh Greek or Parthenon Room.</em>—Here would commence
the grand suite of galleries for large sculptures, of which the general
breadth would be forty-two feet, and the height from thirty to thirty-five
feet. By its side would run a secondary suite, twenty feet wide,
and from fifteen to twenty feet high, for minor specimens, of which the
interest generally is rather archæological than artistic. These latter
objects are both more conveniently classified, and more favourably seen,
in small rooms; if placed in large galleries, beside grand monumental
works, they lose importance themselves, whilst they fritter away the
effect of what is really more valuable. The Seventh Greek Room, which
is two hundred and forty-one feet long, would contain only the remains
of the Parthenon; which might be arranged as indicated in the Plan, so
as at once to keep the pedimental groups and the frieze from interfering
with each other, and to distinguish, more accurately than is now done,
the original connection or disconnection of the several slabs of the frieze.
As we possess the entire frieze from the east end of the temple, and
casts of the entire frieze from the west, these two are here arranged
opposite each other, towards the middle of the two side walls of the
room. On either side are the slabs from the north and south flanks of
the temple, which are mostly disconnected. In front of the casts from
the west is a proposed full-sized model of part of the entablature, supported
by one original and five restored capitals, with the upper parts of
their shafts, and incorporating ten of the metopes, so as to explain their
original combination with the architecture. The total height of this
model might be about eighteen feet. The metopes not included in it
should be attached to the wall opposite, over the frieze. The finest of
the pedimental groups would face the grand entrance from the Lycian
Gallery, through which the whole might be seen in one view, from any
distance less than forty-eight feet. If it were desired to retain the two
small models of the Parthenon in the room, they might stand near the
south end.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Eighth Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXVII. <em>Eighth Greek or Erechtheum Room</em>, sixty-five feet by twenty-six,
for monuments of the era between Phidias and Scopas, of which the
principal are the remains of the Erechtheum.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Ninth Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXVIII. <em>Ninth Greek, or Mausoleum Room</em>, one hundred and twenty
feet in length, forty-two in breadth, and eighty across the transept.—Here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_731'>731</span>would be, 1. The marbles procured by Lord <span class='sc'>Stratford</span> and Mr.
<span class='sc'>Newton</span>, from the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus; in the west transept,
the group from the <em>quadriga</em>, and in the southern part of the room the
other important sculptural and architectural remains of the building,
including the frieze. 2. In the east transept, the colossal lion from
Cnidus, with a few other sculptures of the same school. 3. In the
northern part of the room, the Xanthian Ionic monument, here placed for
comparison with the remains of the Mausoleum. The whole upper portion
of this monument, commencing with the higher of the two friezes which
surrounded the original base, might be reconstructed, though not
restored, and would form a striking termination to the vista through
the galleries. The lower frieze might be arranged against the adjoining
walls of the room.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Tenth Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXIX. <em>Tenth Greek Room.</em>—Having thus passed through the great
monumental series of Greek sculptures in chronological order, the
visitor would return south by the side rooms, containing minor remains
of the same school. The Tenth Greek Room would be forty-two feet
by twenty, and would contain the latest of the smaller sculptures.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Eleventh Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXX. <em>Eleventh Greek Room</em>, thirty-three feet by twenty.—This should
be appropriated to the small fragments from the Mausoleum, which would
thus be in immediate connection with its larger sculptures, without
impairing their grandeur of effect.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Twelfth and Thirteenth Greek Rooms.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXXI, XXXII. <em>Twelfth and Thirteenth Greek Rooms</em>, together one
hundred and thirty-five feet in length and twenty in breadth.—The
exact position of the wall separating these rooms might be reserved till
the arrangement of their contents was settled. In one might be architectural
fragments, from buildings not represented in the large galleries;
in the other, small tablets, votive offerings, altars, and other minor
sculptures.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Fourteenth Greek Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXXIII. <em>Fourteenth Greek or Sepulchral Room</em>, ninety-three feet by
eighteen.—Here would be all the Greek sepulchral monuments now in
the basement. The casts from the sculptured tomb at Myra, of which
the style is more Greek than Lycian, might also be here placed, as indicated
in the plan, in case it should be thought desirable to remove them
from the Lycian Room, though the expediency of this transfer may
perhaps be doubted. Wherever placed, these casts ought to be so put
together as to explain the true arrangement of the originals.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Then follows a Summary of the Accommodation provided in the Plan
for Greek Sculptures, amounting to a superficial area of twenty-seven
thousand four hundred and ten square feet, and to two thousand one
hundred and ninety-one lineal feet of wall-space.]</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Etruscan Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXXIV. <em>Etruscan Room.</em>—The next parallel on the ground floor
would be devoted to the monuments of ancient Italy. The earliest are
the Etruscan, which, being altogether taken from tombs, would properly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_732'>732</span>be placed adjacent, on the one side to the Greek, on the other to the
Roman, sepulchral collections. The principal portion of the Etruscan
Room would be fifty-five feet by forty, with additional recesses at the
south end, the whole about twenty feet high. Two rows of pilasters
would divide the room into three compartments, the central for the
gangway, the other two to be fitted up as a series of tombs, of which the
sides would be formed of the mural restorations, with fac-similes of
paintings from Corneto and Vulci. Within these restored tombs would
be such sarcophagi as we possess, found in the tombs themselves. The
fac-similes of the painted roofs of two of the tombs might be fixed above
them, at such a height as not to obstruct the light. In the central compartment,
which contains six shallow recesses between the pilasters,
might be monuments from various tombs other than those here
restored.</p>

<p class='c007'>XXXV. <em>Staircase Room</em>, forty feet by thirty, and of the same height
as the three united stories of the western galleries.—Four successive
flights of steps would be required to reach each floor. The landings
between the first and second, and between the third and fourth flights,
might each be supported by Caryatid or Atlantic figures, which would
give the whole composition an ornamental effect, as seen from the east
side. Beneath one side of this staircase might be a private one leading
to the western basement.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the north is another private staircase, conducting to the basement
under the Greek galleries. The adjoining passage leads to—</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>First Græco-Roman Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXXVI. <em>First Græco-Roman Room.</em>—The Etruscan monuments are
succeeded chronologically by the Græco-Roman, here placed so as to
adjoin the galleries both of Greek and of Roman art. In accordance
with the character of Græco-Roman sculpture, the apartments containing
it should be somewhat ornamentally constructed and arranged,
as in the great continental museums, where works of this class form the
staple of the collections. The position of the principal objects in all this
series of rooms is marked in the plan, without distinguishing them individually,
as none are of such a character as to require any special architectural
provision. The first room is one hundred and six feet by
twenty-six, exclusive of the alcoves. Its height need not, for the display
of statuary, exceed twenty feet; but if, for architectural effect, a vaulted
ceiling is preferred, the height must be increased. In the Braccio
Nuovo, in the Vatican Museum, which is probably the finest gallery of
this kind in Europe, and has a cylindrical vault, with a central skylight,
the proportion of height to breadth is about thirty-seven feet to twenty-seven;
but in the darker climate of London the height should not, if
possible, exceed the breadth.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Second Græco-Roman Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXXVII. <em>Second Græco-Roman Room, or Rotunda</em>, sixty feet in
diameter, and about sixty feet high in the centre, being surmounted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_733'>733</span>a hemispherical dome.—This room is, with slight variations, and on a
somewhat smaller scale, a copy of the Rotunda in the Museum of Berlin,
an apartment universally admired for its architectural beauty, and only
defective as a hall for sculpture from the unnecessary smallness of the
central skylight. The entablature over the columns would support a
gallery, opening into the first floor of the western buildings.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Third Græco-Roman Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXXVIII. <em>Third Græco-Roman Room</em>, similar to the first, but only
one hundred and one feet long, exclusive of the northern alcove.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spaces between the lateral alcoves on the east side of the First
and Third Græco-Roman Rooms might either be covered with glass, or
left open for ventilation, though the second arrangement would involve
a provision for the drainage below.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Summary of accommodation for Græco-Roman Sculptures.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The amount of accommodation for Græco-Roman sculptures cannot,
from the form of the rooms, be stated with the same exactness
as that for the Greek. Exclusive of the alcoves, there would be in

<p class='c007'>The Rotunda would not have available space in proportion to its size.
Twelve statues or busts between the columns, and perhaps a large
sculpture in the centre, would be the natural complement of the room.
The wall-space behind the columns would not be available for sculpture.
The total accommodation in the three rooms would amply suffice for our
present collection, even somewhat enlarged.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Means of
future enlargement.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
As it increased, however,
further space might be obtained by erecting in the first and third rooms
transverse walls, opposite the alcoves in the Roman galleries, thus subdividing
the first room into three principal compartments, with a small
lobby at each end, and the third into three compartments (of which the
most northern would need some modification), with a lobby at the south
end. The doorways through these walls might be twelve feet wide, so
as to preserve the continuous appearance of the suite; and they would
still leave one hundred and twelve feet of additional wall-space in the
first room, and eighty-four in the third. The lighting would be somewhat
improved by such an alteration.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Western Galleries.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The last suite of galleries on the ground floor would contain the
Roman and Phœnician remains. To avoid any obscuration from the
houses on the west side of Charlotte Street, the windows should be as
high in the wall as possible, and as broad as architectural propriety
<span class='pageno' id='Page_734'>734</span>would admit, whilst the rooms should be not less than twenty-five feet
high.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>First Roman Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XXXIX. <em>First Roman Room</em>, one hundred and ten feet by twenty-eight,
exclusive of the alcoves.—It would contain mosaics, including
those from Carthage, and miscellaneous sculptures, altars, architectural
fragments, &amp;c.; the mosaics indifferently placed on all sides of the
room, the sculptures on the east side and against the two end walls.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Hall.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XL. <em>Hall</em>, fifty-six feet by seventeen.—Here might be an entrance
from Charlotte Street, which on many occasions would furnish a convenient
relief to the principal entrance to the Museum. It would open
immediately into the Rotunda, and through the vista beyond would be
seen, in the distance, the cast of the colossal head from Abousimbul.
Within the two abutments of the Rotunda would be recesses for the
attendants to sell catalogues, receive umbrellas, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Second Roman Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XLI. <em>Second Roman or Iconographical Room</em>, fifty-four feet by twenty-eight,
without the alcoves.—This would contain the series of portrait
statues and busts, in chronological order. The west, or dark side of the
room, could only be used for very inferior sculptures.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Third Roman Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XLII. <em>Third (or Anglo-) Roman Room</em>, the same size as the preceding,
for Roman monuments found in this country. The rude character of
many would admit of placing them on the west side.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Fourth Roman Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XLIII. <em>Fourth Roman or Sepulchral Room</em>, eighty-two feet by twenty-six,
containing Roman sarcophagi for which the west side might be
partially available, and sepulchral cippi, and inscriptions. At the
north-east angle would be a Columbarium, twenty-three feet by fourteen,
fitted up like that in the present Sepulchral Basement Room, but with
the advantage of a skylight.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Then follows a Summary of Accommodation provided in the plan for
Roman Sculptures, amounting to a superficial area (without alcoves) of
eight thousand five hundred and fifty-eight square feet, and seven hundred
and seventeen linear feet of wall-space.]</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Means of future enlargement.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The first three rooms, when their contents sufficiently increased,
would admit of an easy alteration, which would not merely increase the
wall-space, but much improve the lighting, by simply inserting transverse
walls between each window. Against these walls the sculptures
would have a true side light, whilst those against the east wall would
be protected from double lights. It may even be doubted whether such
an arrangement should not be adopted in the first instance, without
waiting till the additional accommodation is actually required.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Phœnician Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XLIV. <em>Phœnician Room</em>, twenty-six feet square.—Here would be the
<em>stelæ</em> and bas-reliefs from Carthage and its vicinity, with the few Punic
inscriptions which we possess. The room contains six hundred and
seventy-six superficial feet, and eighty-eight of wall-space.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Supplemental Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>XLV. A similar room to the preceding, which, in case of necessity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_735'>735</span>might serve for extending the Phœnician collection. In the mean time
it might perhaps be used for exhibiting such miscellaneous inferior
sculptures as could be advantageously weeded from the regular series,
though circumstances might temporarily prevent their removal from
the Museum. In such case it might be entitled ‘Supplemental Room.’</p>

<p class='c007'>In accordance with a suggestion made in the Committee now sitting,
the writer has added to the new buildings proposed in his plan another
story, or second floor, over the first. The advantage of this is, that it
would provide for objects which it might be more costly or inconvenient
to accommodate elsewhere. But it involves necessarily two evils:
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Plan of
Upper
Floors.
Advantages
and evils
of a second
story.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
1. That the height of the second floor, involving an ascent of perhaps
nearly one hundred steps (though this is not more than is common in
continental museums), might excite complaint in English visitors. 2.
That so lofty a building, by excluding all oblique rays from the east side
of the Græco-Roman galleries, would make the light on the statues and
busts there placed somewhat too vertical.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Collections retained or removed.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the collections to be provided for on the upper floors,
it is here assumed, though of course without any express authority, that
Ethnography and Oriental Antiquities would be removed from the
Museum, and better accommodated elsewhere. The British and Mediæval
Collections, however, are supposed to be retained; if they are
removed, a modification of this plan must in consequence be made.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>First Floor or New Buildings for Antiquities; its construction.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The apartments should all be about eighteen feet high, the windows of
the same breadth as those below, but, except in the Terracotta Room,
only about eight feet high, and as near the ceiling as possible. On the
east side should be corresponding windows, so that each wall would be
illuminated; for cross lights, though so injurious to sculptures, are
generally desirable for galleries filled with wall-cases. All the windows
should have ground glass, to prevent injury to the collections from the
sun.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Vase Gallery.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>Vase Gallery.</em>—Two hundred and twenty-two feet long, the southern
half twenty-six feet wide, and the northern twenty-eight feet. The
wall-cases should be about eight feet high, like those in our First Vase
Room; and the transverse projections, flanked by pilasters, would be
only of the same height, so as not to shut out the view of the upper
part of the gallery; having glass on each side, they would serve for
vases with double paintings, such as we now exhibit only in dwarf
central cases. The most important vases should stand isolated on
tables, or pedestals, on each side the gangway; as in the present arrangement
of the Temple Collection.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Its accommodation.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Although the superficial area of this
gallery (five thousand nine hundred and ninety-two feet) is little more
than a third greater than that occupied by vases in the present buildings
(four thousand three hundred and twenty-one feet), the amount of
accommodation it would afford is nearly double. For the present wall-cases,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_736'>736</span>eight feet high, extend to one hundred and forty-six feet of linear
measurement; those ten feet high will, when the collection is fully
arranged, extend to eighty-four feet; the whole therefore may be reckoned
as equivalent to two hundred and fifty-one feet of cases, eight feet
high. The total extent, however, of such wall-cases in the proposed
gallery is four hundred and fifty-five feet. The projections also, with
the tables and pedestals, may safely be estimated as providing twice the
accommodation for vases painted on both sides which is now furnished
by the dwarf central cases, besides exhibiting them much more conveniently.
It should be added that the vases would be better lighted than
at present; whilst the length and comparative openness of the gallery
would produce a more striking impression on the passing visitor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Proposed Etruscan apartment.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The accommodation here provided being so ample, it might be desirable
to appropriate one compartment of the gallery to an exclusively
Etruscan Collection, comprising not merely the pottery of the Etruscans,
properly so called, but that for which they were really more distinguished
in ancient times, their bronze and other metal work.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Terracotta Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Terracotta Room.</em>—Fifty-six feet by seventeen. As no windows
could be made on the east side, there should be no cases on the west;
but the western windows, which do not correspond with the others of
this story, should extend from near the ceiling to four or five feet from
the floor. A sloping case might then be placed in each window, for
lamps and other small objects, requiring a strong light. Against the
east wall should be cases for vases, and other large objects.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Gallery of Rotunda.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Gallery of the Rotunda.</em>—From one hundred and eighty to one hundred
and ninety feet in circumference, and about nine feet wide. The
powerful light from the centre of the dome would be favourable to terracotta
statuettes and bas-reliefs, which could all be contained in shallow
wall-cases, that would not materially narrow the gangway.<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c013'><sup>[48]</sup></a> The
Townley Collection of bas-reliefs, now in the Second Vase Room, might
be arranged in panels all round, so as to produce a decorative effect,
agreeable to their original destination.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Accommodation for Terracottas.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The entire space provided in these two rooms is much more than our
terracottas can absolutely require; but this will facilitate an ornamental
arrangement of the collection, appropriate to the character of the
larger room. The small spaces between the Rotunda and the main
building would serve for closets.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Glass Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Glass Room</em>, twenty-eight feet by twenty-six.—The fittings proper
for glass being different from those of terracottas, it is desirable to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_737'>737</span>it a separate room. This should be similarly arranged to the Vase
Gallery, with wall-cases eight feet high, and table-cases in the centre.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Bronze Gallery. Its accommodation.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>5. <em>Bronze Gallery</em>, three apartments united; together eighty-two feet
by twenty-eight.—As the advantage of a skylight for the bronze statuettes
is necessarily sacrificed by the adoption of an upper floor, it
would be best to place them, as far as possible, against each side of the
transverse projections, separating those sides by internal partitions, and
employing some contrivance to protect the bronzes from the cross light
of the further windows, an arrangement possible with small objects in
glass cases, though not with large statuary. In the middle of the
gallery might be table-cases, placed longitudinally, or important objects
on pedestals. The increase of accommodation in the Bronze Gallery,
as in the Vase Gallery, is more than proportionate to the increase of
space. Though the superficial area is only two thousand two hundred
and ninety-six feet, in lieu of our present quantity, two thousand and
twenty-one, the extent of wall-cases, which now is only one hundred and
thirty-eight feet, would, even allowing doorways of twelve feet wide
between each of these compartments, be increased to two hundred and
fifty feet, equivalent, after allowing for the difference in height of the
cases, to two hundred feet. This, if the Etruscan bronzes were transferred
as already suggested, would liberally provide for the Greek and
Roman Collection.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Second Floor of New Buildings for Antiquities.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Each room should be fifteen to eighteen feet high; the windows exclusively
on the east side, and extending from the ceiling to four or five
feet from the floor. As the aspect is nearly N.E., the sun could not be
injurious, and the glass of the windows, therefore, had better be unground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>British Rooms.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>1. <em>British Rooms</em>, each twenty-seven feet by twenty-six.—That which
adjoins the staircase (and, if necessary, those on each side), should be
lighted from the roof, and have wall-cases all round, with a separate case
in the centre. The other rooms should have wall-cases on the west side,
and shallower cases against the transverse walls. Two long table-cases
in each room might extend from the windows to a line with the
doorway.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Mediæval Rooms.</span></div>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Summary of accommodation for British and Mediæval.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>2. <em>Mediæval Rooms</em>, each twenty-eight feet by twenty-seven, and similarly
arranged to the British.—Though the entire superficial area in the
British and Mediæval Rooms is only five thousand and seventy-two feet,
in lieu of four thousand and forty-six, the amount in the present building,
yet the wall-space is four hundred and sixty-six feet, instead of only
two hundred and ninety-seven, and the cases, having no windows above,
might, if necessary, be made ten feet high, like the present. The gain
in table-cases would be much greater. In lieu of six, there would be
twelve, each sixteen or eighteen feet long, instead of ten; whilst the
central case in the room adjoining the staircase might be at least as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_738'>738</span>capacious as the large separate case in the present British and Mediæval
Room. The lighting would throughout be more advantageous for these
collections than at present; and the rooms, from the character of the
windows, might be bright instead of gloomy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Gem Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>3. <em>Gem Room.</em>—As the contents of this and the succeeding room have
more or less intrinsic value, an iron door might be placed at the end of
the Mediæval Gallery, to be open only when the public are admitted to
the Museum. The Gem Room, twenty-eight feet by twenty-seven, would
be fitted like the preceding. The gems would occupy the table-cases,
which would accommodate a far larger collection than ours, and would
exhibit them in the best possible light for such objects. In the wall-cases
might be displayed the gold and silver ornaments, which would
have much more space than as now arranged, though in a room only of
the same size.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Coin and Medal Gallery.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>4. <em>Coin and Medal Gallery</em>, fifty-six feet by seventeen.—As the dome
of the Rotunda would only rise a few feet above the floor of this gallery,
and would, from its curvature, recede to a distance of several feet, windows
on the east side would be quite unobstructed. In each might stand
a table-case, six or seven feet long, on which would be exhibited, under
glass, a series of coins and medals which, though not the most valuable
of our collection in the eyes of a numismatist, would suffice to give the
public an interesting and instructive view of the monetary art. In the
drawers of these cases might be kept the moulds and casts of the Coin
Collection. Against the side walls might be upright cases, or frames,
for extending the exhibition; but the walls facing the windows, having
a front light, would be unsuitable for coins or medals, and must be employed
for some other purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Private Rooms of Coin Department.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>5. The rooms which remain would be a private suite for the Coin
Department. The present rooms of that department are arranged in
an order the reverse of what is best for security and convenience, the
coins being kept in an outer room, which must be passed in going either
to the Keeper’s study, or to the Ornament Room, a room open to all
persons merely on application. In the accompanying plan the contents
of the Ornament Room have been transferred to the Gem Room;
and the Keeper’s study is placed near the beginning of the private
suite.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Outer Coin Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'><em>Outer Coin Room</em>, twenty-eight feet by twenty-seven, for the freer
exhibition of coins to properly introduced persons, for the use of artists
copying coins or other minute objects, and all other purposes now served
by the Medal Room, except the custody of the collection, and work of
the department.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Inner Coin Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'><em>Inner Coin Room</em>, fifty-five feet by twenty-eight, secured by a strong
iron door, of which the Keeper, Assistant-Keeper, and Principal-Librarian,
would alone have keys.—In this room, to which none but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_739'>739</span>departmental staff would be admitted, the coins and medals would be
preserved, arranged, and catalogued; they would be carried hence by
the officers into the Outer Room when required for inspection. The
room is somewhat more than half as large again as the present Medal
Room; and as the absence of visitors, and of the barriers their presence
now requires, would leave the whole space free, there would be ample
accommodation for any probable enlargement of the collection. The
library of the department might be arranged partly in this, partly in
the Outer Room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the apartments reserved as private, two are placed at the south
end of the first and second floors, and each of these might, if necessary,
be subdivided into two small studies, each twenty-six feet by thirteen,
for the use either of officers or students.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Private
Rooms in
Plan.
Others
suggested.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Private rooms are, however,
required on the ground floor, to replace the female students’ room, and
the Assistant-Keeper’s study, proposed to be removed for the new Nimroud
and Khorsabad Galleries. The most effectual provision for these
and other wants would be one which has been suggested during the
present inquiry, namely, to transfer to the Department of Antiquities
the several rooms now occupied as the Trustees’ Room and adjoining
offices, and to remove the official establishment to new rooms to be
erected on the east side of the Museum. Should this be found impracticable,
the present Insect Room, and adjoining studies, might, in the
event of the transfer of this part of the Zoological Department to the
upper floor, furnish the required accommodation. In default of both these
alternatives, rooms might be constructed north of the new Assyrian
Galleries, though, in the opinion of the writer, this ground should only
be built over as a last resort.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Use of basement.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The basement, both of the old and new buildings, would, though
unfitted for exhibition, and shut up from the public, be more or less
available for workshops, storing-places, retiring-rooms, &amp;c. No part of
the existing basement would be made altogether useless, though the
rooms under the present Greek Galleries would all be somewhat darkened.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Lighting of
basement.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The basement under the new buildings may, with reference to
lighting, be divided into three classes:—1. The rooms under the first six
or small Greek Rooms, the south end of the Etruscan Room, and the
north end of the Greek Galleries, would all have ordinary windows, and
be better lighted than any part of the basement now used for the
purposes mentioned. 2. The rooms under the Roman Galleries, which
would also have windows, would be less well lighted than the preceding,
being some feet below the level of Charlotte Street, and being
further somewhat obscured by the grating over the area, and the
parapet to screen it from passengers in the street, which would both
probably be thought necessary. 3. The basement under the Græco-Roman,
and greater part of the small Greek Galleries, would receive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_740'>740</span>a partial light from the openings between them. To increase this, however,
and to furnish the only light to the basement under the Fourteenth
Greek Room, and the apartments adjoining its west side, panels
of strong glass or open metal work might be inserted at convenient
places in the various floors, and serve rather as an ornament to them.
With the aid of some such arrangement, the last-mentioned portions of
the basement would serve as storing-rooms; in default of it, they could
merely be available for any apparatus used in heating or ventilation.</p>

<p class='c007'>[Then follows a General Summary of Additional Space provided for the
Collections of Antiquities, amounting to a net addition of forty-one
thousand nine hundred and fifty-six square feet of superficial area.]</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Summary of space for Antiquities.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>This is somewhat less than the additional space demanded in the
estimate supplied to the Committee by Mr. <span class='sc'>Hawkins</span>; but it supposes
the removal of the Oriental and Ethnographical Collections, which
Mr. <span class='sc'>Hawkins</span>, when considering only the existing department, and
not the question of its modification, included in its contents.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Extra space.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>In addition, however, to the space provided for the collections, the
new buildings would comprise about eight thousand six hundred feet
on the three principal floors, for studies, closets, staircases, &amp;c.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Space in basement.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The space in the basement it is unnecessary to estimate in detail,
being manifestly superabundant for its purpose.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Space transferred to Natural History.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The Plan of the Upper Floors shows the accommodation which might
be provided, upon the present scheme, for the Departments of Natural
History, by transferring to them the galleries and studies on that floor
now occupied by Antiquities, and constructing an upper room on the
site of the staircase, to unite the Central Saloon (Return 379, Plan 18,
No. 1), into which the new principal staircase would conduct, with the
galleries so transferred. The apportionment of the space amongst the
different collections of Natural History must be left to more competent
authorities than the present writer. He may, however, add a few words
on the general character of the apartments comprehended in the transfer.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Public
Galleries.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The public galleries are similar to the present Zoological Galleries, not
merely in their structure, but in their fittings. The wall-cases, therefore,
might be available, without alteration, for the new collections; and the
central cases might either be retained for Natural History, or removed
to the new upper floors for Antiquities, as was found more convenient.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Studies for
officers
and students.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The present Medal and Ornament Rooms might serve for the use of
students, whilst the four private studies numbered 6, 7, 10, and 10 in
Plan 18, would be used by the officers.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Suggestion
for increasing
those for
students.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The rooms for students might,
if necessary, be further increased by a trifling alteration, in the event of
the official establishment being transferred to the east of the Museum.
In place of the closet adjoining the Medal Room, a private staircase
might descend by a few steps to the entresol below, the whole of which
might then be made an appendage to the upper, instead of the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_741'>741</span>floor, and would furnish two convenient rooms for students, over those
numbered 4 and 6 in Plan 17. The same staircase, falling in with one
already existing between the entresol and Secretary’s Office, would supply
a private communication between the upper and lower floors, in lieu of
that abolished for the construction of the First Egyptian Room (III, 69).</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Summary of space for Natural History.</span></div>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Convenience of giving it a distinct floor.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Independently of the increased accommodation, the advantage of
acquiring for Natural History the exclusive possession of the upper floor
is obvious and unquestionable, though the gain is not limited to that
department. By separating its galleries entirely from those of Antiquities,
the practical superintendence of each would be simplified; one department
would no longer be a necessary thoroughfare to another; the
confusion of ideas experienced by ordinary visitors from the juxtaposition
of collections so incongruous would be avoided; and as each department
would have a separate entrance, a facility would be given for
varying their periods or regulations of admission, as the circumstances
of each might at any time require; considerations which must hereafter
acquire increasing weight in proportion to the increasing magnitude of
the Museum.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Estimate of approximate expense.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The ground immediately round the Museum, on the average of its
three sides, is valued in the Report of the Special Committee of Trustees
(twenty-sixth November, 1859), at about forty-three thousand five
hundred pounds per acre.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Expense of
ground.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The houses in Charlotte Street are inferior
in character to those on the other two sides, and might doubtless be
purchased at a proportionately less price; but the writer, being anxious
to err only on the safe side, assumes the average price as necessary.
The ground proposed to be taken is about four hundred and fifty feet
long, by a breadth generally of one hundred and fifty feet, but at the
south end not exceeding one hundred and ten feet; so that the total area
is about sixty-four thousand seven hundred square feet, or somewhat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_742'>742</span>less than an acre and a half. The price, therefore, may be set down at
sixty-five thousand pounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buildings are estimated in the same report to cost about two pounds
per square foot, reckoned upon the total internal area of the principal
floors, without the basement. This calculation is founded on buildings
consisting of a basement, a ground floor, and one upper floor.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Of buildings.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The
buildings proposed by the writer are in one respect more costly than
these, as their basements bear a larger proportion to those floors on
which the cost is calculated. But in two other respects they are more
economical:—1. Because they include, in one part, a second floor, which
swells the space from which the expense is calculated, without involving
any addition to the basement. 2. Because some of the galleries on the
ground floor are not really separate buildings, but parts of a single block
of buildings, subdivided merely by partition walls. On the whole, therefore,
the estimate of two pounds per foot seems the safest basis of
calculation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now the quantity of internal area or floor space in the proposed new
buildings is—</p>

<table class='table0'>
  <tr>
 <td class='btt blt c016'>For the collections</td>

<p class='c007'>This gives, therefore, one hundred and sixty thousand seven hundred
and twenty pounds for buildings, which, added to sixty-five thousand
pounds for ground, would amount to two hundred and twenty-five
thousand seven hundred and twenty pounds. A further sum must be
added for alterations of the existing building, particularly for the removal
and reconstruction of the staircase, and the formation of the two
rooms described as III (69) and XIII (15). Assuming the expense of
these alterations, quite conjecturally, at ten thousand pounds, the total
cost would be two hundred and thirty-five thousand seven hundred and
twenty pounds. The largeness of the valuation allowed for the ground
gives reason to believe that the actual expense of ground and buildings
would not exceed, and might probably fall short of, this estimate.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Means of future extension.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>[In concluding his remarks on this plan of reconstruction, Mr. <span class='sc'>Oldfield</span>
points out that if ever hereafter further extensions should be required,
they might be obtained without material disturbance of the proposed
galleries.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Appendix to

Evidence</cite>,

<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad fin</span></i>.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
For Antiquities, one or more additional houses might be purchased
either in Bedford Square, commencing with No. 4, or in Charlotte
Street, commencing with No. 3. The former would be required for the
prolongation of the Greek, Græco-Roman, or Roman Galleries; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_743'>743</span>latter for the Etruscan or Phœnician. For the minor collections on the
upper floors either side would be equally appropriate. If further space
were needed for Natural History, galleries might be built as suggested
by Professor <span class='sc'>Maskelyne</span>, extending either northwards to Montague
Place, or eastwards to Montague Street, as found convenient.]</p>

<p class='c011'>To the clear and forcible exposition of his plan, thus given
by its framer in the paper submitted to the Committee of
1860, many further elucidations were added in evidence.
But enough has already been quoted for the perfect intelligibility
of the plans so proposed for the sanction of the
Trustees and of Parliament.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><cite>Minutes of
Evidence</cite>,
June, 1860,
Q. 2034, p.
143.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
‘I think,’ said Mr. <span class='sc'>Oldfield</span>,
when questioned, in the Committee, as to the extent of provision
<em>for the probable future</em> requirements of the Museum,
‘the proper mode is to secure so much space as will at least
meet those demands which are likely to occur during the
construction of the building; and then, above all, to adopt
a system of construction which would at any future time
admit of an extension, without derangement of that which
now exists, and so would obviate the very great expense
and inconvenience which has hitherto occurred from alterations
and reconstructions.’</p>

<p class='c011'>In reporting upon this plan, originally framed in 1858,
the Committee of 1860, after comparing with it two other
but only partial plans of extension and re-arrangement, prepared
respectively by Mr. Sydney <span class='sc'>Smirke</span> and by Mr.
Nevil <span class='sc'>Story-Maskelyne</span>, observe: ‘Your Committee have
reason to think that if any of these plans were adopted—involving
the [immediate] purchase of not more than two
acres of land, with the [immediately] requisite buildings
and alterations—the cost would not exceed three hundred
thousand pounds. If, however, only this limited portion of
land should be at once acquired, it is probable that the price
of what remains would be enhanced. If the whole were to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_744'>744</span>be purchased, as your Committee have already recommended,
the cost above stated would be, of course, increased.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The recommendation here referred to has been already
quoted in a preceding chapter, together with a statement of
the grounds on which it was based.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>See Chap. III of Book III.</div>

<p class='c011'>The only additional elucidation, on this head, which it
seems necessary to give may be found in a passage of the
evidence of one of the Trustees, Sir Roderick <span class='sc'>Murchison</span>,
who, in 1858, with other eminent men of science, presented
a Memorial to the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, praying
that the British Museum might <em>not</em> be dismembered by
any transference of the Natural History Collections to
another locality. After saying: ‘I entirely coincide still in
every opinion that was expressed in that Memorial, and I
have since seen additional and stronger reasons for wishing
that [its prayer] should be supported,’ Sir Roderick added:
‘When it was brought before us [that is, before a Sub-Committee
of Trustees] in evidence, that if we were largely
to extend the British Museum at once <em>in sitû</em>, and that as
large a building were to be made <em>in sitû</em> as might be made
at Kensington, we then learned that the expense would be
greater. But I have since seen good grounds to believe
that by purchasing the ground rents or the land, to north,
east, or west, of the Museum, according to a plan which I
believe has now been prepared and laid before the members
of the Committee [referring to that of Mr. <span class='sc'>Oldfield</span>, just
described], and availing ourselves of the gradual<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c013'><sup>[49]</sup></a> power of
enlargement&#160;...

the Nation would be put to a much less
expense for several years to come, and would in the end
realise all those objects which it is the aim<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c013'><sup>[50]</sup></a> of men of
science to obtain.’</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_745'>745</span>The chief alternative plan is based on the transference of
the Natural History Collections to an entirely new site, and
on the devotion to the uses of the Literary and Archæological
Departments of the Museum of the whole of the space so
freed from the scientific departments.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Plan for the transference of the Natural History Collections to Kensington (or elsewhere). 1861–62.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>The Committee of 1860 condemned this plan in the
main (but only, as it seems, by a single voice upon a
division), but what that Committee had under consideration
was only the first form into which the plan of separation
had been shaped. At the end of the year 1861 and
beginning of 1862, that plan was again brought before a
Sub-Committee of the Trustees, at the express instance of
the Lords of Her Majesty’s Treasury, and it was thus
reported upon:—</p>

<p class='c007'>The Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury state in that
Minute, ‘That, in their judgment, some of the collections ought to be
removed from the present buildings, and that they will be prepared to
make proposals at the proper time to the Royal Commissioners of the
Exhibition of 1851, with a view to the provision, on the estate of the
Commissioners, of space and buildings, which shall be adequate to
receive in particular, at first the Mineralogical, Geological, and Palæontological
Collections, and ultimately, in case it shall be thought
desirable, all those of the Natural History Departments.’ Their Lordships,
after having invited the Trustees to prosecute the further examination
of the question, continue as follows:—‘It will have to be
considered what other or minor branches of the collections may, with
propriety or advantage, be removed to other sites, or even made over, if
in any case it might seem proper, to other establishments.’</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_746'>746</span>Your Committee have, therefore, thought it their duty at the outset
to examine whether all the Natural History Collections, viz. the Zoological
and Botanical, in addition to the Geological, Palæontological,
and Mineralogical, specified in the Treasury Minute, might with
propriety and advantage be removed from the present British Museum
buildings.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>All Collections
of
Natural
History to
be removed.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The importance, as regards science, of preserving together
all objects of Natural History, was forcibly urged by Sir R. <span class='sc'>Murchison</span>,
at the special general meeting of the third of December. In a Memorial
laid before the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1858, and signed by more
than one hundred and twenty eminent promoters and cultivators of
science,<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c013'><sup>[52]</sup></a> it was represented ‘that as the chief end and aim of natural
history is to demonstrate the harmony which pervades the whole, and
the unity of principle, which bespeaks the unity of the Creative Cause,
it is essential that the different classes of natural objects should be
preserved in juxtaposition under the roof of one great building.’ Your
Committee concur in this opinion, and they have come to the conclusion
that it is essential to the advantage of science and of the collections
which are to remain in Bloomsbury, that the removal of all the objects
of Natural History should take place, and, as far as practicable, should
be simultaneously effected.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Botany.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>With regard to Botany, it is a question whether the existence of the
Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew does not suggest an exception as to
the place to which the British Museum Botanical Collection should be
removed, reserving a small series for the illustration of fossil Botany, in
connexion with Palæontology.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be kept in view that the removal of the Palæontology, Geology,
and Mineralogy, would leave unoccupied only two very inconveniently
placed rooms in the basement, besides the north half of the north
gallery on the upper floor (about four hundred feet in length, by thirty-six
in width); whereas the recently imported marbles from Halicarnassus,
Cnidus, Geronta, and Cyrene, fill completely the space under the
colonnade, extending to about five hundred and forty feet in length.
Nor can your Committee omit to add, that should the removal of the
Botany and Zoology be delayed, the final and systematic arrangement
of the collections which are to remain must be equally delayed; while,
if any portions of these were removed to other situations in the Museum,
or their final transfer postponed, many of the objects retained would
have again to be shifted for the sake of congruity and economy of
space.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, therefore, recommended by your Committee, that all the Natural
History Collections be speedily and simultaneously removed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Ethnological Collection to be removed.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Together with these the Ethnological Collection ought to be provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_747'>747</span>for elsewhere. Most of the objects which it contains have no affinity
with those which are contained in the other parts of the Museum, nor is
the collection worthy of this country for its extent, nor yet, owing to its
exceptional character, is it brought together in a methodical and
instructive manner. Occupying but a secondary place in the British
Museum, it cannot obtain either the space or the attention which it
might obtain, were it not surrounded and cast into the shade by a vast
number of splendid and interesting objects which have irresistible
claims to preference. Mr. <span class='sc'>Hawkins</span> was of opinion, ‘that if Ethnography
be retained,’ it would be necessary to quadruple the space for its exhibition.
The Select Committee in their report (p. vii), state that ‘they
have received evidence from every witness examined on this subject in
favour of the removal of the Ethnographical Collection.’ If it were to
be retained, an area of ten thousand feet (same report, p. xi) would be
required. Your Committee cannot, therefore, hesitate to recommend
the removal of the Ethnographical Collection to a fitter place.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Portraits.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Nor can
they hesitate in proposing the removal, from the present Ornithological
Gallery, of the Collection of Portraits hanging on the walls above the
presses containing the stuffed birds. Those paintings having no
connexion with the objects for the preservation of which the Museum
was founded, would never have been placed there had there been a
National Portrait Gallery in existence for their reception.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Space left vacant.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The following is a detailed statement of the space which would be left
vacant in various parts of the Museum by the removal of the above
collections....</p>

<p class='c011'>Then follows an enumeration, first, of the space left
vacant by the removal of the Geological, Palæontological,
and Mineralogical Collections, amounting in the whole to
an area of twenty thousand one hundred and thirty-five
feet; secondly, of the space left vacant by the removal of
the Zoological Collection, amounting to an area of thirty-five
thousand four hundred and twenty-eight feet; thirdly,
of the space left vacant by the removal of the Botanical
Collection, amounting to five thousand nine hundred feet;
and, finally, of the space left vacant by the removal of the
Ethnological Collection, namely, a room on the south side
of the upper floor, marked ‘3’ on the plan, ninety-four feet
by twenty-four, giving an area of two thousand two hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_748'>748</span>and fifty-six feet; and giving, in the whole, an aggregate
area of sixty-five thousand and seventy-nine feet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Treasury Minute; alteration of present building.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Having enumerated the collections which might, with
propriety and advantage, be removed from the British
Museum, and stated the extent of new accommodation
which would consequently be gained for other collections,
the Committee proceeded to consider, in the words of the
Treasury Minute, ‘the two important questions—first, of
such final enlargement and alterations of the present buildings
as the site may still admit, and as may be conducive
to the best arrangement of the interior; secondly, of the
redistribution of the augmented space among the several
collections that are to remain permanently at the Museum,
among which, of course, my Lords give the chief place to
the Library Departments and the Antiquities.’</p>

<p class='c011'>The Committee, agreeing with their Lordships that the
chief claims in the redistribution of the augmented space
are those of the Antiquities and of the Library Departments,
then proceed to say that—</p>

<p class='c007'>They have thought themselves bound also to pay attention to certain
other important purposes, to which a portion of the space to be obtained
by alterations within and by building on some remaining spots of unoccupied
ground, might be beneficially applied.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Trustees’ Offices.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee have, in the first place, had their attention drawn to
that part of the existing buildings appropriated to the administrative
department of the Museum. The want of space for clerks, for Museum
publications, for stationery, for the archives of the Trust, for papers of
all descriptions, for the transaction of business with officers and servants
of the Trustees, and with tradesmen, as well as the want of a waiting-room
for strangers of all ranks who have to attend on the Trustees, or
wish to have interviews with their chief officer or any of the persons
attached to his office, is the cause of great embarrassment and discomfort.
To which is to be added the inconvenience caused by the unsuitable
arrangement of the rooms, which renders those who occupy them
liable to perpetual interruptions. Moreover, by the strict rule forbidding
the admission of artificial light into the Museum, the period of
available working time is occasionally much abridged. Another site
<span class='pageno' id='Page_749'>749</span>must be found for this department; there are no means of providing on
its present site against the evils above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the next place, your Committee have taken into consideration the
absolute necessity of providing for the exhibition of specimens of coins
and medals, always intended by the Trustees, but never carried into
effect for want of space.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Exhibition
of Coins
and
Medals.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
And not only a selection of coins and medals,
but also one of gems, cameos, and valuable ornaments, should be exhibited
to Museum visitors. The want of room for such a purpose is the
source of great trouble and inconvenience. The present Medal Room is
much too confined even for the arrangement and preservation of its
contents, and for such accommodation of its officers as is necessary to
enable them to perform properly their duties. Moreover, as visitors
cannot be indiscriminately admitted to the Ornament Room, still less
to the Medal Room, such of them as do not take the proper steps for
gaining access to those rooms are debarred from seeing even specimens
of objects which acquire a peculiar interest in proportion to the strictness
with which they are guarded. The general visitors should have an
opportunity of satisfying their laudable curiosity by seeing a good selection
of coins, just as they can at the present time see interesting specimens
of manuscripts and printed books; scholars and persons who have
special reasons for examining coins leisurely and minutely, ought to
have the means of doing so comfortably under proper regulations, and
in a separate room, in the same manner as readers are allowed to use
books; but no stranger should be admitted into the room where the
Collection of Coins and Medals is preserved unless in rare and exceptional
cases, and always in the presence of the Principal-Librarian, or the keeper
of the department.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Exhibition or Prints and Drawings.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>In the third place, your Committee, being aware of the importance of
space for the due exhibition of prints and drawings, and of the repeated
complaints of the keeper of that department, who cannot find room
wherein to arrange the collection so as to have it safely preserved as well
as readily accessible, have given their best attention to those complaints.
Most of the inconveniences which are felt by visitors, as well as by
Museum officers, in the existing Medal Room, are equally felt in the
existing Print Room; and many of the wants which it is suggested
should be provided for to make the Collection of Coins and Medals as
useful and instructive as it ought to be in a great national institution,
are wants against which provision must be made in order to render
equally useful and instructive the Collection of Prints and Drawings.
These wants are ample space for classing, arranging, and preserving the
bulk of the collection, as well as ample space wherein to exhibit, for the
amusement and instruction of the public generally, such a selection of
prints and drawings as may be calculated to give a general notion of
both arts from their infancy to comparatively modern times, in various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_750'>750</span>countries, and according to the style of the most celebrated masters.
Studies should likewise be provided for the keeper, and also for an assistant-keeper,
in this department, as well as accommodation for artists
who come to copy or study critically any of the objects, or classes of
objects, forming part of this collection, and for those who come for the
purpose of researches requiring less minute attention, and who desire to
see a variety of prints and drawings in succession.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Binders’ Shops.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>In the fourth place, your Committee have taken into consideration
the want of space for carrying on the binding of the Museum books.
The Collection of Manuscripts, and, much more, that of Printed Books,
have of late years been increasing with unexampled rapidity; but the
bookbinders’ accommodation has not been increased in a corresponding
ratio. The damage caused, particularly to new books, placed unbound
in the readers’ hands, may well be conceived; and the Trustees were
compelled, by the necessity of the case, to sanction an expedient of
doubtful legality, by allowing a large number of books, which in case of
misfortune might be easily replaced at a comparatively small outlay, to
be taken out of the Museum to be bound in a house immediately opposite
to it, hired by the bookbinder. Your Committee think that such an
arrangement, avowedly a temporary one, ought not to continue a
moment longer than is unavoidable; and that adequate provision should
be made as speedily as possible within the Museum premises for binding
all books belonging to the Trust.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Alterations and redistribution of space generally.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee will now proceed to consider the questions of the
final enlargement and alterations of the present buildings, and of the
redistribution of the augmented space for the several purposes above
mentioned. In making the following proposals, your Committee have
kept in view the principle that it would not be advisable for the Trustees
to appropriate specifically to particular objects any particular
space. They will, therefore, as much as possible, confine themselves to
stating how the augmented space should be generally redistributed
among the remaining collections, giving the chief place to the Antiquities
and Library; the arrangement of the particular objects or classes
of objects should rest on the responsibility of the head of each department,
who would in due time submit his views to the Trustees. Your
Committee also wish it to be clearly understood that the structural
details herein suggested or implied, must be considered liable to such
modifications as the farther development of the scheme may require.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_750fp.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p>BRITISH MUSEUM.<br /><br />PLAN OF THE GROUND FLOOR.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>New staircases.</span></div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_751'>751</span>In the building as now arranged, the principal staircase (No. 69 on
the plan of the ground floor) is situated on the left in the Entrance
Hall (No. 2); opposite to the entrance is the corridor (No. 80) leading
to the Reading-Room; east and west of that corridor, between the main
building and the new Library, there is an area (No. 70 and 79) about
thirty feet wide unoccupied. It has long been suggested that the principal staircase should be removed from No. 69, and that two staircases
be erected on the area 70 and 79, one on each side of No. 80. The hall
entrance (No. 2) would be lighted by the skylight already existing in
the roof, and by a corresponding opening to be made in the upper floor.
The site of the principal staircase, No. 69, would be occupied by a large
room, seventy-five feet by thirty-five, giving an area of two thousand
six hundred and twenty-five feet, exactly like the one opposite to it (No.
58) in height as in every other respect, with a floor on a level with the
rest of the building.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Present Roman Gallery.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>There are blank windows on the north side of the principal staircase
that would have to be cut through to light the new room, and additional
light could be admitted if necessary. On the south of the projected
new room is a narrow room, ninety-four feet by twenty-four (No. 3),
designated as the Roman Gallery, the light of which is very defective,
especially on the side of the windows opening under the front colonnade.
The Collections of Antiquities contain some large objects, more
interesting archæologically than artistically, for which light on each
side of them is very desirable. If the wall now separating the staircase
from No. 3 were removed, and pilasters or columns substituted (the
upper part of that wall in the floor above might likewise be removed if
desirable), a room ninety-four feet by sixty, giving an area of five thousand
six hundred and forty feet, admirably adapted for antiquities of
this kind, would be obtained.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Trustees’ present Offices.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>At the western extremity of the Roman Gallery (No. 3), and turning
southward, are the Trustees’ room (No. 4), two rooms for clerks (No. 5
and 6), and the study of the Principal-Librarian (No. 7). It is proposed
to remove all the partition walls inside the space occupied by No. 4, 6,
and 5, and by the corridor on the east of No. 4, and to open windows on
the west side at the same height, and uniform with those in the gallery
No. 17, of which this part of the building would then be a continuation,
opening a communication like that on the corresponding side on the
east (between No. 56 and 63). The Egyptian Gallery might thus be
extended to the total length of four hundred and sixty-five feet.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>New buildings on No. 11.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>By removing the corridor and study No. 7, as well as the projection
on the north side of the house now occupied by Mr. <span class='sc'>Carpenter</span>, so far
west as the point at which it would intersect a prolongation to the south
of the west wall of the first Elgin Room, a plot of unoccupied ground,
one hundred feet by seventy-five, might be turned to great advantage.
The interior arrangement of this newly acquired space would depend on
the purposes to which the Trustees should think fit to apply it: whether,
for instance, it might be advisable to throw into it the third Græco-Roman
Saloon (No. 10), which is now by common consent too narrow,
or whether the western part of that plot of ground had not better be
set out as a continuation of the Elgin Room, which should be carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_752'>752</span>through the end of the above room (No. 10) and of the Lycian Room
(No. 13). Before finally deciding this point it would be imperative to
determine what is to be done with the Lycian Room, which is in an
unfinished state, because it neither is nor ever was large enough for the
collection for which it was intended; whilst, on the other hand, it contains
objects which ought never to have been placed there, and which
ought to be removed. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Space
acquired
(No. 4, 5, 6, 7,
10, 11, 13).</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Until the keeper of the department has before
him a correct plan of all the space which he may eventually have at his
disposal, and until he has well considered how the objects to be placed
ought to be arranged, he cannot give a decided opinion upon any scheme
for building on the plot now under consideration. For the present purpose
it is enough to say that the Trustees’ room and those annexed
(No. 4, 5, and 6), giving an area of about two thousand nine hundred
and fifty feet on the ground floor, and a large piece of ground, one
hundred feet by seventy-five, may be beneficially applied to the Department
of Antiquities.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Buildings on No. 31 and 32, and alteration of present Print Room.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>No. 14 and 18 are the two Elgin Rooms, containing the finest reliques
of Greek art in existence, which have remained unarranged for years,
owing to the difficulties which the space hitherto available presented for
their definitive arrangement, and to the uncertainty of the final appropriation
of the space No. 31. It seems, however, to be generally
admitted that on the unoccupied plot of ground, No. 31, a continuation
of the second Elgin Room should be erected of the same width, to
include the Print Room, the floor of which should be lowered to the
general level of the Museum ground floor, and its width extended westward
about seven feet. Another gallery might thus be formed altogether
four hundred and seventy-five feet long and thirty-seven wide. Should
it not extend farther than the southern extremity of the first Elgin Room
(No. 14), its length would be three hundred and thirty feet. The plot
of ground, No. 32, ought also to be applied to the accommodation of
Antiquities. The study No. 23 should be done away with.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Alteration
of staircase,
No. 27.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The two
lower flights of the N.W. staircase, No. 27, should be taken down and
reconstructed in No. 26 and 36, with the necessary alterations to reconnect
them with the two upper flights, which would remain as they are
now. The studies No. 28, and passage No. 29, should be cleared away,
as well as those above them, together with the lower part of the western
wall of No. 27, the southern wall of that space being continued to
No. 30, thus forming a passage or gallery, about twenty-two feet wide,
for communication between the Northern Egyptian Gallery and the
new gallery to be erected at the north of the Elgin Rooms. From
the new passage thus formed there should be an opening on the south
side, and a flight of steps to descend to the gallery which is to be built
on No. 32. There would be room under the new staircase, in the
space No. 36, to form an additional study for the Printed Book
Department, where it is much wanted. Upon No. 32, a gallery should
be erected from the basement, like the Assyrian Gallery, No. 15, to both
of which access might be had by two handsome staircases, descending
north and south of No. 19, from which it is taken for granted the
Phigaleian Marbles and other objects, now there, would be removed, the
central space being applied to better purposes.</p>

<p>BRITISH MUSEUM.<br /><br />PLAN OF THE GROUND FLOOR.<br />WITH THE<br />PROPOSED ALTERATIONS.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_753'>753</span>It does not appear to your Committee that any farther accommodation
for Antiquities can be procured on the ground floor, without interfering
with rooms now appropriated to the Library.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>New gallery on No. 32, like one now on No. 13.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>On the north side of the upper floor, all that portion marked 21, 32,
31, 30, 29, 33, 28, and 27, on the plan of that floor, now occupied by
Geology, Palæontology, and Mineralogy, should be transferred to the
Antiquities. It would be desirable to remove the two studies, marked
21, at the western extremity of that floor, and to add so much more
space to the gallery for exhibition.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Space for Antiquities on north upper floor.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>But before proceeding farther, your Committee wish to make one or
two remarks on the advantages which all the galleries on the upper
floor offer for the exhibition of Antiquities, even of considerable size
and weight, were any of the space on this floor wanted for such objects.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Fitness of
upper floor
for such
purposes.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
With respect to light, as all these galleries may, if requisite, be lighted
by skylights (those on the east and west being so already), they will so
far meet with the approbation of those who are considered judges of the
kind of light peculiarly required for the exhibition of sculptures. The
size of the rooms gives ample space for the public exhibition of Antiquities,
including statues, not much less than life-size, if necessary;
whilst the galleries, though lofty, will not dwarf them. Competent
critics have pronounced that it is a mistake to suppose that all sculptures
look better in magnificent rooms. The solidity of the Museum
building, throughout, leaves no doubt of its upper floor being strong
enough to receive ordinary marble statues, not to speak of busts and
smaller objects. The floor of the western end of the northern gallery,
marked No. 21 and 32 on the plan, offers extra solidity, as it rests
on substantial walls at intervals of twelve feet from each other.
Your Committee have been assured by their architect that a mass of
marble, weighing several tons, might be safely deposited on any part of
that floor.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Studies.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>With respect to the northernmost central portion (No. 33) of the
gallery now under consideration, it could not be better applied than to
studies for the officers of the Department of Antiquities. Five such
studies might be formed therein, each eighteen feet by sixteen, opening
on a corridor six feet wide and eighty-four long, in which might be
kept the Departmental Collection of Books for the common daily use
of the occupiers of those studies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole of the eastern side of the upper floor, including rooms 35 to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_754'>754</span>40 (all Zoology), together with the rooms marked 41 (Zoology), 42, 43
(Botany), 1 (Zoology), 2 (the site of the principal staircase, as well as
the smaller staircase on the west of it), and finally No. 3 (Ethnography),
should be transferred to the Departments of Antiquities; subject to the
consideration whether the rooms No. 42 and 43 might not be reserved
for the Department of Manuscripts, if at any time required. Space is
wanted, not only for Antiquities now unprovided with any accommodation,
but also for the display of future additions, and for the better
arrangement of what is now unsatisfactorily exhibited, either too far from
the eye or in dark corners. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Space for
Antiquities
on the
east and
south upper
floors.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
A large number of objects, to be seen as
they ought to be, must be spread over twice the space which they fill at
present; a great many more, now placed where they cannot be seen at
all, ought to be removed to more suitable situations.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>West side
of upper
floor to
remain for
Antiquities.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The whole of the
west side—that is, rooms 9 to 15—would continue to be applied to the
exhibition of Antiquities; it is not, however, to be assumed that the
objects now there would necessarily be left where they are, nor yet that,
for instance, Egyptian Antiquities should necessarily occupy the same
galleries which they occupy at present. From room No. 14 must be
removed either the Egyptian Antiquities now in it, or the Temple
Collection, which was placed there from absolute necessity, there being
no other space whatever where it could be exhibited. The British and
Mediæval Collections would probably have to be removed to some other
part of the upper floor, now occupied, or which it is now proposed should
be occupied, by Antiquities, where the transition would be less abrupt
than from Egyptian to Mediæval.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Exhibition of Coins and Medals.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>As before suggested, space should be set apart for the exhibition of
Coins and Medals, besides that which is required for their safe custody,
arrangement, and study. Your Committee will presently state how the
latter ought to be provided for. As to the public exhibition of coins, the
three rooms, 8, 5, and 4, in which the coins, medals, gems, &amp;c., are now
kept, would be admirably adapted for the purpose, after the internal
partition walls are removed. It would be desirable to preserve the two
rooms, 6 and 7, the one as a study for an assistant, who should be always
at hand to give information connected with the coins exhibited close
by, and to answer such questions as would not require reference to the
general collection; the other as a waiting-room, to which a stranger
might be more safely and freely admitted, on the understanding that
nothing valuable be kept in it, whilst admission to the assistant’s room
should be much more sparingly granted. An obvious reason for applying
this part of the premises to the above purpose is, that it is provided
with special doors, windows, and locks, for the safety of the present
contents. And as the objects which it is proposed should be therein
exhibited would be of some considerable value, advantage should be
taken of the existing arrangements for their security. It is to be noted
that this exhibition would not interfere with the arrangement of any
Collection of Antiquities, with none of which could the coins and
medals properly mix, although so nearly allied to them.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_755'>755</span>The corresponding part of the upper floor on the south-east corner,
No. 44 and 45, is perfectly well adapted for the exhibition of prints and

<p class='c007'>Your Committee have endeavoured to show how far a portion of the

buildings, and by building on some remaining spots of unoccupied
ground, may with propriety and advantage be applied to the Departments
of Oriental, Mediæval, and Classical Antiquities, of the Coins and
Medals, and of the Prints and Drawings; your Committee will now
show what part of that accommodation might be made available for
Printed Books and Manuscripts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Printed Books.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>When the erection of the new Library and Reading-Room was suggested,
it was stated that that Library would hold eight hundred
thousand volumes; that is, the annual increase for forty years, calculating
that increase at twenty thousand volumes. But the annual increase
has been, during the last five years, at the rate of upwards of thirty
thousand volumes, and during the last four years at the rate of about
thirty-five thousand, which number, however, is ultimately reduced by
the practice of binding two or more volumes of the same work in one;
while, on the other hand, the new building will certainly contain two
hundred thousand volumes more than it was originally estimated to
hold; so that if the present rate of increase continues, as it ought, the
new Library will be full in about twenty-five years from this date. It
was necessary to say thus much, as a notion seems prevalent that a
great deal more was promised when that building was suggested, and
that the number of books, which that new Library can hold, may
reach an almost fabulous quantity, and the space be sufficient for an
extravagant number of years.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Rooms in basement transferred to Printed Books.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The rooms on the basement floor of the north side, both marked 15
on the plan of that floor, and now occupied by Geology, cannot be
otherwise appropriated than to the Department of Printed Books; the
same is to be said of the seven small rooms, marked 17, now used for
Geology, as well as of rooms 18 and 19 on the east side, now used for
Zoology; all these rooms are immediately under the Department of
Printed Books, and naturally belong to it. The rooms marked 13, 14,
and 16, from west to east, were formerly appropriated to the Department
of Printed Books, to which they should now be restored. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_756'>756</span>the first importation of Halicarnassian Antiquities took place, they were
deposited temporarily in these rooms, as no other space whatever could
be found in which to shelter and unpack them. In this space are now
arranged the Inscriptions, which have had to be removed from under
the colonnade to make room for the Marbles recently arrived from
Cyrene. Appropriate space for the Inscriptions will be found without
difficulty in the Department of Antiquities, enlarged according to the
foregoing suggestions, or, at all events, in the basement, either now
existing or to be built under the galleries for Antiquities on the west side
of the Museum, where sufficient light may be procured for objects like
these, which are of no great interest to sightseers, and therefore need
not be publicly exhibited; enough that they be easily accessible to the
small number of antiquarians and scholars who may wish to examine
them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Part of North Gallery in upper floor to Printed Books.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The north galleries on the upper floor are divided lengthways, from
east to west, into two portions; that now containing Zoological Collections
(No. 22 to 26) can be advantageously appropriated to the Department
of Printed Books when required. The volumes placed there can
be easily lowered down and returned through a hoisting apparatus to be
placed at either the south-east or south-west corner of No. 24, immediately
above No. 41 on the ground floor—the nearest point of any in
the main Library to the Reading-Room. By these various alterations
space would be provided for about two hundred and fifty thousand
printed volumes, in addition to that which still remains available in
that department, from which, however, space for about fifty thousand
volumes would have to be deducted, as will be presently shown.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Want of space in Department of Manuscripts.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Although there is now space remaining in the Department of Manuscripts
for the accommodation of twelve thousand volumes, and although
the annual average increase of manuscript volumes may be safely
reckoned at less than six hundred and fifty, your Committee have, nevertheless,
felt that prospective increased accommodation should now be
provided, not only for the Collection of Manuscripts, but still more for
artists and readers who have occasion to refer to select manuscripts, as
well as for assistants, of whom two, together with one attendant and
eight readers, are pent up in a space of thirty feet by twenty-three,
crowded with tables, chairs, &amp;c., which scarcely allow room for moving
from one place to another or for access to the officers’ study on each
side. The Head of the Department of Manuscripts has recently represented
to the Trustees his want of six assistants; but he has, at the
same time, been obliged to state that, if appointed, he should not know
where to place them. The Trustees have complied with his request, to
the extent of granting two new assistants; and he will experience great
difficulty in placing the two who are to be appointed. Add to this, the
interruption to which each of these persons is unavoidably liable from
each of the others in the performance of his duties and occupations,
owing chiefly to the narrow space in which they are confined.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>BRITISH MUSEUM.<br /><br /><span class='sc'>Plan of the UPPER FLOOR with the PROPOSED ALTERATIONS.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_757'>757</span>On account of its locality, the Department of Manuscripts cannot
derive any direct advantage from the removal of the Natural History
Collections; no space which will thus become vacant can be rendered
available for the purpose of remedying the inconveniences here stated.
As, however, the Department of Printed Books obtains the additional
accommodation before mentioned, a portion of the space now occupied
by Printed Books, very conveniently situated to supply the wants of the
Department of Manuscripts, ought to be transferred to this department.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Space to be transferred from Printed Books to Manuscripts.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>It is, therefore, proposed that the study, marked No. 57 on the ground floor
plan, be removed to the north end of No. 55, now occupied by
Printed Books, and that the site of No. 55 be attached to the Department
of Manuscripts. In that gallery, one hundred and fifteen by eighteen,
excellent accommodation, with abundance of light, would be found for
twenty thousand manuscript volumes—for fifteen students at least (this
number is ample if admission be strictly and <em>bonâ fide</em> limited to the
class of persons for whom it is intended) at separate seats, each having
a table space of two feet and a half in depth and four in length,—and
for ten assistants or more, admirably placed for superintendence. The
area of the eastern recess of No. 56 would then be quite clear, and available
for the exhibition of manuscripts, like the western recess in the
same room. And when as large an exhibition of manuscripts as the
space permits is accessible to the public (and still more accommodation
for this exhibition might be found in the present Department of Manuscripts),
the same restrictions as have been suggested with respect to
coins and to prints ought to be imposed on the handling of select
manuscripts.</p>

<p class='c007'>It now remains to find space wherein to provide proper accommodation
for the binder, as well as for the Trustees’ offices, for the Collection
of Prints and for the Collection of Coins.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Buildings in the garden attached to Principal-Librarian’s house.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>On the east side of the roadway parallel to the Department of Manuscripts,
there is a piece of ground extending to Montague Street on the
east, to the house No. 30, in that same street towards the north, and to
the Principal-Librarian’s house on the south. On a portion of this
ground stands an old building, now partly appropriated to the binder
and partly used as a guard-house; the remainder forms the garden
attached to the residence of the Principal-Librarian. It appears to your
Committee that by substituting a new building for the one existing, and
by building on the greater part of the garden, ample accommodation
will be found for what is wanted. Your Committee cannot abstain from
mentioning that this great sacrifice of personal convenience on the part
of the Principal-Librarian was suggested and brought under their notice
by that officer himself.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_758'>758</span>It was some years ago suggested by the Government that the military
guard might be dispensed with at the Museum; at times when the
services of the army were pressingly required, it was felt that soldiers
might be more usefully employed than in being kept for mere show at
the Museum. It was, however, thought that on removing the military
guard, better provision should be made for the safety of the Museum.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Military guard discontinued.</span></div>

<p class='c011'>Then follow various details of minor consequence; to
which succeed an enumeration of the additional space
gained for the Collections of Printed Books, Manuscripts,
Prints and Drawings, Antiquities, Coins and Medals, as
well as for offices, store-rooms, bookbinders’ shops, &amp;c.,
by the proposed alterations, as respects each of the
several Departments of Printed Books, Manuscripts, and
Antiquities; and a summary of the whole, from which it
appears that the additional space gained by the Department
of Printed Books amounts to an area of seventeen thousand
eight hundred and three square feet; that the additional
space gained by the Department of Antiquities
amounts to sixty-seven thousand six hundred and ninety-two
square feet; and, finally, that the additional space
gained by the Department of Manuscripts amounts to three
thousand four hundred and thirty square feet.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_760'>760</span>Your Committee, proceeds the Report, do not think it necessary to
give the particulars of the accommodation which the unappropriated
portions of the basement floor would afford for the preservation of moulds,
as well as for the formatore, for making and preserving casts of statues
and other large objects, as well as of gems and seals, and also for providing
such decent and suitable conveniences as the health and comfort of
the thousands who visit the Museum absolutely require.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Future use of basement.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>It is, perhaps, unnecessary to do more than simply to remind the
Trustees that the want of space at the Museum has been felt and has
been urged on the Government for several years past, and that during
the last four or five years the additions to the Collections of Antiquities
have been so rapid and so numerous, as to render it impossible to do
more than provide for them temporary shelter at a considerable expense,
and to the great disfigurement of the noble façade which entitles the
Museum to claim rank among the most classical buildings of modern
times.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>Urgency of
building at
once.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
Should the above proposals of your Committee meet with the
approbation of the Trustees and the sanction of the Government, they
ought to be carried into effect without delay. The Government would,
doubtless, lose no time in providing a proper building for the reception
of such collections as are to be removed from the Museum; until this
removal has taken place, no redistribution of the vacated space can
be undertaken; but the new structures proposed to be erected on ground
now unoccupied ought to be proceeded with at once, that they might be
rendered available as speedily as possible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>What to be first put in hand.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>Your Committee are of opinion that the new building facing Montague
Street, the building for the bookbinder, the building intended to be
erected on the ground now vacant between the Elgin Room and the
Print Room, and the construction of the new principal staircases, should
be commenced immediately. The building intended to be erected on
the vacant ground on the west of the Trustees’ Room (No. 11 on the
plan), must, necessarily, be postponed for awhile. The alterations
which might and ought to be rapidly completed, are those which
will be required on the east side of the King’s Library (No. 55 and 57),
to transfer the gallery to the Department of MSS. from that of Printed
Books.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span class='sc'>Committee of Trustees to be appointed.</span></div>

<p class='c007'>The Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty’s Treasury state that ‘they
will be prepared to enter upon the details of these questions in communication
with the Trustees, and even, if it should be desired, to offer
suggestions upon them.’ Your Committee are of opinion that the
proffered assistance should be at once accepted; and that in order to
derive all possible advantage from that assistance a small Committee
of Trustees should be appointed to carry on the necessary communications
with the Treasury, either verbally or otherwise, and to consider
with their Lordships all suggestions that might be offered respecting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_761'>761</span>points touched upon in this Report, and their details. This Committee
would be similar to that which the Trustees requested the Treasury to
appoint, by letter of the twentieth of June, 1829, and which was afterwards
appointed by the Trustees themselves, with the approbation of
their Lordships, to direct and superintend, not only the works then in
progress, but those to be afterwards undertaken.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the tenth of February, 1862—after the communication
of this Report to each of the Trustees individually—the
recommendations of the Sub-Committee were unanimously
approved, at a Special General Meeting of the
Trustees, at which twenty-four members of the Board
were present.

After the adoption of the plans thus
accepted, another Sub-Committee of Trustees was appointed
to confer with the Treasury in order to their realisation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Before Parliament, this plan of severance and of re-arrangement—after
some modifications of detail which are
too unimportant for remark—was supported, in 1862, with
the whole influence of the Government. But it failed to
win any adequate amount either of parliamentary or of
public favour. Some men doubted if the estimated saving,
as between building at Bloomsbury and building at Kensington,
would or could be realized. Others denied that
the evils or inconveniences attendant upon severance would
be compensated by any adequate gain on other points.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span><span class='sc'>The Parliamentary
Debate of
1862.</span><span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
The popularity of the Natural History Collections; the
facilities of access to Great Russell Street; the weighty—though
far from unanimous—expressions of opinion from
eminent men of science in favour of continuance and
enlargement, rather than of severance and removal; all
these and other objections were raised, and were more or
less dwelt upon, both in the House of Commons and in
scientific circles out of doors, scarcely less entitled to discuss
a national question of this kind. The Commons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_762'>762</span>eventually decided against the project by their vote of the
19th May, 1862.</p>

<p class='c011'>Substantially,—and in spite of small subsequent additions
from time to time to the buildings at Bloomsbury—the
question of 1862 is still the question of 1870. As I
have said, it has been my object to state that question
rather than to discuss it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Should it seem, after full examination, that good
government may be better maintained, and adequate
space for growth be efficiently provided, by enlarging the
existing Museum, would it be worthy of Britain to allow
the additional expenditure of a few scores of thousands of
pounds—an expenditure which would be spread over the
taxation of many years—to preponderate in the final vote of
Parliament over larger and more enduring considerations?</p>

<p class='c011'>In the session of 1866 Mr. Spencer <span class='sc'>Walpole</span> spoke
thus: ‘You must either determine to separate the Collections
now in the Museum, or buy more land in Bloomsbury....
I have always been for keeping them together.
I am, however, perfectly willing to take either course,
provided you do not heap those stores one on another—as
at present,’ (July, 1866)—‘in such a manner as to render
them really not so available as they ought to be to those
who wish to make them objects of study.’ Few men are
so well entitled to speak, authoritatively, on the question—because
few have given such an amount of time and labour
to its consideration.</p>

<p class='c011'>By every available and legitimate expression of opinion
the Trustees have acted in the spirit of this remark, made
almost four years since, by one of the most eminent of
their number. The words are, unfortunately, as apposite
in March, 1870, as they were in July, 1866.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Loakes had been purchased from the last owner of the Archdall
family by Henry, Earl of Shelburne. Earl William (first Marquess of
Lansdowne) eventually sold it to the ancestor of the present Lord
Carrington.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. This famous speech was delivered on the 5th of March, 1778. ‘<em>Then</em>,’
said Lord Shelburne, after denouncing measures which would sever the
Colonies from the Kingdom, ‘the sun of Great Britain is set. We shall
be no more a powerful or even a respectable people.’—<cite>Parliamentary
Debates</cite>, vol. xix, col. 850.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. More than one of Burney’s scholars was accustomed to speak feelingly
on the topic of ancient school ‘discipline’ when any passing incident
led the talk in that direction in after life.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f6'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. This small fact in classical bibliography is remarkable enough to
call for some particular exemplifications, beyond those given in the text,
on a former page. Of the three greatest Greek dramatists, Burney had
315 editions against 75 in the Library of the British Museum. Of
Homer he had 87 against 45; of Aristophanes, 74 against 23; of Demosthenes,
50 against 18; and of the <cite>Anthologia</cite>, 30 against 19.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. It was also from the Edwards fund that the whole costs of the
Oriental MSS. of Halhed, and of the Minerals of Hatchett, together
with those of several other early and important acquisitions, were
defrayed. That fund, in truth, was the mainstay of the Museum during
the years of parliamentary parsimony.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. Of these four thousand pounds, two thousand three hundred and
forty-five pounds seem to have been expended in Printed Books; the
remainder, probably, in Manuscripts.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. To give but one example: Samuel Burder—the author of the excellent
work, so illustrative of Biblical literature, entitled <cite>Oriental Customs</cite>—states,
in his MS. correspondence now before me, that the <em>only</em> effective
reward given to him, in the course of his long labours, was given by Lord
Bridgewater. The book above mentioned was ‘successful,’ ‘but,’ he
says, ‘the booksellers, as usual, reaped the harvest,’ not the author.
It is—shall I say?—an amusing comment on this latter clause, to find
that in one of his letters to Lord Bridgewater, Burder states that
the person who took the most kindly notice of his literary labours,
next after Lord Bridgewater himself, was—the Emperor of Russia
(Alexander I).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. These form the Egerton MSS. 215 to 262 inclusive.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. Horace Walpole, at this sale, purchased the fine MS., with drawings
by Julio Clovio, which was long an ornament of the villa at Strawberry
Hill, and also a choice cameo of Jupiter Serapis, for which he gave a
hundred and seventy-three pounds. He preferred, he said, either of
them to the vase. So, at least, he fancied when he found it unattainable.
‘I am glad,’ he wrote to Conway (18 June, 1786), ‘that Sir Joshua saw
no more excellence in the <em>Jupiter</em> than in the Clovio, or the Duke, I
suppose, would have purchased it as he did the Vase—for £1000. I told
Sir William and the late Duchess—when I never thought that it would
be mine—that I would rather have the head than the vase.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. Lord Harcourt resigned his office of Governor to the Prince at the
beginning of December, 1752. Scott, then the Prince’s tutor, was
recommended to his office by Bolingbroke. The Bishop of Peterborough’s
appointment as Preceptor was made in January, 1753.
Among the books complained of, the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de la Grande Bretagne</span></cite>
of Father Orléans, and the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Introduction à la vie du Roi Henri IV</span></cite> of
another Jesuit, Father Péréfixe, are said to have been included. Another
and more famous book, which was much in Prince George’s hands in his
early years, was also obnoxious to the Whigs—Bolingbroke’s <cite>Idea of a
Patriot King</cite>. But it would scarcely have been prudent in the malcontents
to have put a work which (whatever its faults) ranks, to some extent,
among our English classics, in the same expurgatory, or prohibitory,
index with the books of Orléans and of Péréfixe. If George the Third
got some harm out of Lord Bolingbroke’s book, he probably obtained
also some good. Pure Whiggism—pure but not simple—has never been
noted for any discriminating tolerance of spirit. And, in 1752, it was
furious at the prospect that the continuance of its long domination was
imperilled.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. The mansion for which the Trustees of the British Museum had
been asked to give £30,000 was sold, five years afterwards, to the King
for £20,000. It was purchased for the Queen as a jointure-house in lieu
of her proper mansion, Somerset House, then devoted to public purposes.
All the royal princes and princesses were born in Buckingham House,
except George IV, and one, perhaps, of the younger children.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. The story, I observe, has been endorsed in Mr. Blades’ excellent <cite>Life
of Caxton</cite> (see part 2, p. 268), but it is undoubtedly a distortion or
exaggeration of some chance occurrence. No such series could have
been formed otherwise than, in the main, by systematic research.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. Curiously enough, three volumes of the Georgian MSS. had belonged
to Sir Hans Sloane, and had, in some unexplained way, come to be
separated from the bulk of his Collection. They now rejoined their old
companions in Great Russell Street.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. Solander, who was afterwards to be so intimately connected with the
Banksian Collections, had been for some years in this country when he
was selected by Banks to be one of his companions in the voyage of <cite>The
Endeavour</cite>. He was born in Sweden, in the year 1736. He came to
England in July, 1760. He succeeded Dr. Maty, as Under-Librarian of
the British Museum, in 1773, when Maty was made Principal-Librarian.
At that date he had already served the Trustees for many years as one of
their Assistant-Librarians.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. Bishop Horsley certainly forgot the ever-memorable words which
he had so often read—Matt. v, 44—when he, a prelate, signed himself
‘Misogallus.’</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. Morton died at eighty-three; Planta, at eighty-four; Ellis, at
ninety-two. Morton, as we have seen, was known to Sir Hans Sloane.
Sloane was already a noted man in the days of Charles the Second;
and he also lived to be ninety-two. The joint lives of Sloane, Morton,
and Ellis extended over nearly two hundred and ten years.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. I do not make this statement without ample warrant. When preparing,
under Lord Romilly’s direction, my humble contribution of
the lost <cite>Liber de Hyda</cite> to the series of <cite>Chronicles and Memorials</cite>, I had
competent occasion to test the <cite>Monasticon</cite> of 1813–1824, and found it to
teem with errors and oversights in that part of it which I had then to
do with. I had had other occasions to study it somewhat closely twenty
years before, and with like result. At the interval of twenty years, one
could hardly stumble twice upon exceptionally ill-edited portions of such
a book. For the new ‘Dugdale,’ thus truthfully characterised, subscribers
paid a hundred and thirty pounds for small paper, two hundred
and sixty pounds for large paper, copies; and the number of subscribers
was considerable. So much for the ‘We must retrench’ of the
publishers.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. After stating that Mr. Ellis had made needless proclamation at
Paris of the object of his journey, Sir Harris Nicolas proceeds thus:—‘Not
contented with this injudicious and useless development of the
objects in view, the learned gentleman himself pompously announced
wherever he went that he was the “Chief Librarian of the British
Museum,” sent specially to treat for these manuscripts, thus making a
public affair of what should have been kept private. The effect of this
folly may easily be imagined. Long before the “Chief Librarian”
reached Pomard, the French newspapers expressed their indignation
that historical muniments should be sold to the British Government,
inferring that England must be anxious to possess the records in
question, when the purchase of them was made an official business.</p>

<p class='c011'>‘The effect of all this parade upon the owner of the manuscripts was a
natural one; he fancied he had erred in his estimate of their value, and
that, as they seemed to be objects of national importance to another
Government, he resolved to make that Government pay at a much
higher rate, for what they manifested such extraordinary anxiety to
obtain, than a private individual. On the “Chief Librarian’s” arrival at
Pomard, he discovered that the Baron could speak little English; and
the Baron, as he has since asserted, discovered that the “Chief
Librarian” could speak less French; hence it was with great difficulty
that the latter could understand that the Baron had become so enlightened
about his treasures as to expect, not merely double the price he
originally asked for them, but as our Government had interfered on the
subject, he wished it to advance one step further, by inducing his Most
Christian Majesty to raise his Barony into a Comté. Such terms were
out of the question; and after spending two or three hours only in examining
the Collection, but which required at least as many weeks, the
“Chief Librarian” returned to England <em>re infecta</em>, and made his report
to the Trustees, who refused to purchase the Collection, but offered to
buy a few documents, which the owner, of course, declined. Thus, highly
valuable documents are lost to the Museum and to the country, in consequence,
solely and entirely, of the absurd measures adopted for their
acquisition.’—<span class='sc'>Nicolas</span>, <cite>Observations on the State of Historical Literature
in England</cite>, pp. 78–80. My long and observant acquaintance with Sir
H. Nicolas justifies me in adding to this extract—in which there are
such obvious exaggerations of statement—that I am convinced he was
writing from insufficient and inaccurate information. He was incapable
of wilful misstatement.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. I was myself present at an interview (in Lambeth), when the most
urgent influence was used with Mr. Hawes to induce him to attack
Mr. Panizzi’s original appointment as an ‘Assistant-Librarian’; and I
heard him express a strong approval of it, on the ground of the obvious
qualifications and abilities of the individual officer—though himself
sharing the opinion that in such appointments Englishmen should
have the preference.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. It was in the old rooms in the Court-yard of Montagu House that
Charles Lamb enjoyed the last, I think, of his ‘dinings-out.’ A few
days after his final visit (November, 1834) the hand of Death was already
upon him. Cary, before writing the well-known epitaph, wrote some other
graceful and touching lines on his old friend. They were occasioned by
finding, in a volume lent to Lamb by Cary, Lamb’s bookmark, against
a page which told of the death of Sydney. They begin thus:—</p>

      <div class='line in2'>The water, thirsting, and near Heaven.’</div>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. It is necessary that I should state, with precision, the sources of the
information conveyed in the text. I rely, chiefly, on three several sources,
one of which is publicly accessible. My main knowledge of the matter
rests (first) upon the <cite>Minutes of Evidence</cite> taken by Lord Ellesmere’s
Commission of 1848–1850; (secondly) upon conversations with the late
Mr. Edward Hawkins, held in July and August, 1837, not long after
the appearance of Mr. Cary’s letter in <cite>The Times</cite>; (thirdly) upon a conversation,
on the same subject, with which I was honoured by Sir Henry
Ellis in 1839.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. I believe that his earliest contribution consisted of some articles
entitled ‘Notes of a Reader,’ published in 1830, in a periodical (long
since defunct) called <cite>The Spirit of Literature</cite>. These were written and
printed long before Mr. Watts became a correspondent of the <cite>Mechanics’
Magazine</cite>, as mentioned in the text.</p>

To the brief extract, for which alone I can here afford space, were
appended, in the original Report, many pertinent amplifications and
illustrations. Some of these are given in the <cite>Minutes of Evidence</cite> above
referred to.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r33'>33</a>. If the question of mere hints and analogies in construction were to
be followed out to its issues, the result, I feel assured, would in no
degree tend to strengthen the contention of Mr. Hosking’s pamphlet.
Something like a first germ of the mere ground-plan of the new Reading-Room
may, perhaps, be found in M. Benjamin Delessert’s <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Projet
d’une Bibliothèque circulaire</span></cite>, printed, at Paris, as far back as the year
1835, when the question of reconstructing the then ‘Royal,’ now
‘Imperial Library,’ was under discussion in the French Chambers. ‘I
propose,’ says Delessert, ‘to place the officers and the readers in the
centre of a vast rotunda, whence branch off eight principal galleries, the
walls of which form diverging radii&#160;... and <em>have book-cases on both
sides</em>,’ &amp;c. His plan may be thus shown, in small. The differences, it
will be seen, between this sketch and Mr. Panizzi’s sketch of 1854, are
greater than are the resemblances.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r38'>38</a>. Nor was there any petty or unworthy jealousy in the distinguished
French explorer. ‘During the entire period of his excavations,’ writes
Mr. Layard, ‘M. Botta regularly sent me, not only his [own] descriptions,
but copies of the inscriptions, without exacting any promise as to the
use I might make of them. That there are few who would have acted
thus liberally, those who have been engaged in a search after Antiquities
in the East will not be inclined to deny.’—<cite>Nineveh and its Remains</cite>,
vol. i, p. 14.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c011'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. It is a slight blemish in Mr. Layard’s otherwise admirable books
that they are loose in the handling of dates. It is sometimes necessary
to turn over hundreds of pages in order to be sure of the year in which
a particular excavation was made, or in which an interesting incident
occurred. Sometimes, again, there is an actual conflict of dates, <em>e. g.</em>
<cite>Discoveries in the Ruins</cite>, &amp;c. (1853), p. 3, ‘After my departure from
Mósul in 1847,’ and again, p. 66, ‘On my return to Europe in 1847;’ but
at p. 162, we read: ‘Having been carefully covered up with earth, previous
to my departure in 1848, they [the lions] had been preserved,’ &amp;c.
I mention this simply because it is possible that error may thus, once or
twice, have crept into the marginal dates given above, though pains has
been taken about these.</p>

interest, because of its sacred associations, when they call to mind those
first-century travels of certain famous travellers who, ‘after they had
passed throughout Pisidia, came to Pamphylia, and&#160;... when they
had gone through Phrygia,&#160;... and were come to Mysia, assayed to go
into Bythinia, but the Spirit suffered them not;’—having work for them
to do in another quarter.</p>

<p class='c011'><a href='#r42'>42</a>. I shall not, I trust, be suspected of a want of gratitude for the
eminent and most praiseworthy efforts of Mr. Davis—one of the many
Americans who have returned, with liberal profuseness, the reciprocal
obligations which <em>all</em> Americans owe to Britain (for their ancestry, and
also for the noble interchange of benefits between parent and offspring,
prior to 1776; if for nought else), if I venture to remark that the above-written
passage in the text has been inserted somewhat hesitatingly, as
far as it concerns the <em>date</em> of the Carthaginian explorations. No index;
no summary; no marginal dates; conflicting and obscure dates, when
any dates appear anywhere; no introduction, which introduces anything;
scarcely any divarication of personal knowledge and experiences, from
borrowed knowledge and experiences; such are some of the difficulties
which await the student of <cite>Carthage and her Remains</cite>. Yet the book is
full of deep interest; its author is, none the less, a benefactor to Britain,
and to the world.</p>
